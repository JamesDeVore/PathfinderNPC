SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Arcane Accuracy (Su) You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant yourself an 
insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus on all attack rolls until the end of your turn. 
Arcane Pool (Su) You have a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that you can draw upon to fuel your powers 
and enhance your weapon. This arcane pool has a number of points equal to ½ your magus level 
(minimum 1) + your Intelligence modifier. The pool refreshes once per day when you prepare your 
spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are 
holding a +5 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with 
existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with 
themselves. These bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, 
flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal. Adding these properties 
consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s base price modifier. These properties are added to 
any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 
enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and 
properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you 
use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You 
can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If you use this ability again, the first use 
immediately ends. 
Counterstrike (Ex) Whenever an enemy within reach of you successfully casts a spell defensively, that enemy 
provokes an attack of opportunity from you after the spell is complete. This attack of opportunity cannot 
disrupt the spell. 
Empowered Magic (Su) You can cast one spell per day as if it were modified by the Empower Spell feat. This 
does not increase the casting time or the level of the spell. 
Evasion (Ex) You can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If you make a successful Reflex saving 
throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no 
damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. You do not gain the 
benefit of evasion when helpless. 
Fuse Style (Ex) You can fuse two of the styles you know into a more perfect style. You can have two style feat 
stances active at once. Starting a stance provided by a style feat is still a swift action, but when you 
switch to another style feat, you can choose one style whose stance is already active to persist. You may 
only have two style feat stances active at a time. 
Greater Spell Combat (Ex) Whenever you use the spell combat ability, your concentration check bonus equals 
double the amount of the attack penalty taken. 
Improved Spell Combat (Ex) When using the spell combat ability, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus on 
concentration checks, in addition to any bonus granted by taking an additional penalty on the attack roll. 
Improved Spell Recall (Su) Whenever you recall a spell with spell recall, you expend a number of points from 
your arcane pool equal to ½ the spell’s level (minimum 1). Furthermore, instead of recalling a used 
spell, as a swift action you can prepare a spell of the same level that you have in your spellbook. You do 
so by expending a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the spell’s level (minimum 1). You 
cannot apply metamagic feats to a spell prepared in this way. You do not need to reference your 
spellbook to prepare a spell in this way. 
Knowledge Pool (Su) When you prepare your magus spells, you can decide to expend 1 or more points from 
your arcane pool, up to your Intelligence bonus. For each point you expend, you can treat any one spell 
from the magus spell list as if it were in your spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If 

you do not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time you prepare spells, you lose those spells. 
You can also cast spells added in this way using your spell recall ability, but only until you prepares 
spells again. 
Maximized Magic (Su) You can cast one spell per day as if it were modified by the Maximize Spell feat. This 
does not increase the casting time or the level of the spell. 
Quarterstaff Defense (Ex) While wielding a quarterstaff, you gain a shield bonus to your Armor Class equal to 
the enhancement bonus of the quarterstaff +3, including any enhancement bonus on that staff from your 
arcane pool class feature. 
Quarterstaff Master (Ex) You gain the Quarterstaff Master feat as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the 
normal prerequisites. You only gain the benefit of this feat when wearing no armor or light armor. 
Quickened Magic (Su) You can cast one spell per day as if it were modified by the Quicken Spell feat. This 
does not increase the casting time or the level of the spell. 
Reflection (Su) You can sacrifice 1 or more points from your arcane pool as an immediate action to reflect a 
spell back at its caster. This functions as spell turning, but only if the targeted spell is of a level equal to 
or lower than the number of points expended. If insufficient points are expended, they instead grant an 
insight bonus on any saving throws allowed by the spell, equal to the number of points spent. 
Spell Combat (Ex) You’ve learned to cast spells and wield weapons at the same time. This functions much like 
two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you must 
have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a 
light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your 
attacks with your melee weapon at a –2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with 
a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If 
you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to 
your Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus to your concentration check. 
If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the 
spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but you cannot cast the spell in between weapon attacks. 
Spell Recall (Su) With a swift action you can recall any single magus spell that you have already prepared and 
cast that day by expending a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the spell’s level 
(minimum 1). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. 
Spellstrike (Su) Whenever you cast a spell with a range of “touch” from the magus spell list, you can deliver 
the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch 
attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, you can make one free melee attack with your weapon (at 
your highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its 
normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, 
this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the 
weapon’s critical range (20, 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar 
effects), but the spell effect only deals ×2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage 
uses its own critical modifier. 
Staff Weapon (Su) You treat any magical staff you are wielding as a magical quarterstaff with an enhancement 
bonus to attack and damage equal to the staff’s caster level divided by 4 (minimum +1). The staff must 
have at least 1 charge for you to use this ability. You can restore 1 charge to a staff by expending a 
number of points from your arcane pool equal to the level of the highest-level spell cast in the staff, as 
long as at least one spell in the staff is on the magus spell list. You cannot restore charges to more than 
one staff per day. 
Wand Wielder (Su) You can activate a wand or staff in place of casting a spell when using spell combat.
