SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bonded Object (Sp) If you attempt to cast a spell without your bonded object worn or in hand, you must make 
a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. A 
bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that you have in your spellbook and are 
capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by you, 
including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on your caster level. This spell cannot be 
modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from 
your opposition schools. The magic properties of your bonded object, including any magic abilities 
added to the object, only function for you. 
Counterspell Mastery (Su) You gain Improved Counterspell as a bonus feat. You may attempt to counterspell 
an opponent’s spell once per day as an immediate action (instead of a readied action). You must use a 
spell at least one level higher than the spell being countered to use this ability. You can use this ability 
once per day at 6
th-level, plus one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th. 
Disruption (Su) As a melee touch attack, you can place a disruptive field around the target. While the field is in 
place, the target must make a concentration check to cast any spell or to use a spell-like ability in 
addition to any other required concentration checks. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + twice the 
spell’s level. If the check is failed, the target’s spell is wasted. This field lasts for a number of rounds 
equal to ½ your wizard level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 
+ your Intelligence modifier. 
Greater Dispel Magic Your dispel check modifier with greater dispel magic is +34 (+36 if you have someone 
magically imprisoned within your robe). 
Lore Seeker You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks, and Knowledge (arcana) is a class skill 
for you. If you cast arcane spells, pick three spells on your spell list. You are particularly adept at casting 
these spells, so they function at +1 caster level when you cast them, and their save DCs (if any) gain a 
+1 bonus. 
Magical Lineage When you apply metamagic feats to the above spell, treat its actual level as 1 lower for 
determining the spell’s final adjusted level. 
Ongoing Spells You have cast the contingency and lesser astral projection spells upon yourself. Your real body 
resides in a secure location while your projection travels the material plane. Should you ever lose 
consciousness against your will you are affected as though you had cast magic jar upon yourself, using 
your bejeweled amulet as the jar. Additionally, you have used the permanency spell to give yourself the 
benefits of arcane sight and greater darkvision. The following spells are also regularly active upon your 
projection: countless eyes, cushioning bands, delay pain, endure elements, greater false life, mind blank, 
moment of prescience, overland flight, protection from arrows, and ride the waves. What’s more, you 

often keep a phantom steed and an unseen servant by your side, mask all of your magical gear with 
magic aura, and conceal all of your magical writings with illusory script (with the suggestion to return 
the item to Sela, explain the reason for taking it, and to apologize), excluding those that are already 
subject to explosive runes. All ongoing spell effects function at 16th-caster level (and thus require a DC 
27 caster level check to dispel). Their respective effects are included in the above stats where 
appropriate. 
Resistance (Ex) You gain resistance 10 to an energy type of your choice, chosen when you prepare spells. This 
resistance can be changed each day. Unless specified otherwise, assume it applies against fire.
