SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Accuracy (Ex) You halve all range increment penalties when making ranged attacks with a bow or crossbow. 
Camouflage (Ex) Once per day, you can craft simple but effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. 
You need 1 minute to prepare the camouflage, but once you do, it is good for the rest of the day or until 
you fail a saving throw against an area effect spell that deals fire, cold, or acid damage, whichever 
comes first. You gain a +4 bonus on Stealth checks while within terrain that matches the foliage used to 
make the camouflage. This ability cannot be used in areas without natural foliage. 
Deadly Range (Ex) You increase the range at which you can apply your sneak attack damage by 20 feet (for a 
total of 50 feet). 
Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage 
on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light 
armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Fast Stealth (Ex) You may move at full speed while using the Stealth skill at no penalty. 
Skulker You gain a +1 racial bonus on attacks against foes who are denied their Dexterity bonus to AC. 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals 4d6 extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to 
AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flank your target. Should you 
score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as 
sneak attacks only if the target is within 50 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, 
whip, or an unarmed strike), you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal 
damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, 
not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital 

spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with 
concealment. 
Sniper’s Eye (Ex) You can apply your sneak attack damage on ranged attacks targeting foes within 30 feet that 
benefit from concealment. Foes with total concealment are still immune. 
Swift as Shadows You possess incredible stealth even while moving through obstructed areas. Reduce the 
penalty for using Stealth while moving by 5, and reduce the Stealth check penalty for sniping by 10. 
Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC even if you are caught flat-footed or struck by an 
invisible attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
