SPECIAL ABILITIES 

Blizzard (Sp) You can create a savage winter storm centered on you. This power acts as control winds, but in 
addition the entire area (not including the “eye” at the center of the storm) is affected as a sleet storm 
and all in the area are exposed to extreme cold. You may use this ability once per day. 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to 
cold. This also changes the spell’s type to cold. Additionally, whenever you cast a spell with the cold 
descriptor, increase the spell’s save DC by 1. 
Cold Steel (Sp) You can touch a weapon or up to 50 pieces of ammunition as a standard action, giving it the 
frost property for a number of rounds equal to ½ your sorcerer level (minimum 1). You can confer the 
icy burst property instead, but the duration of the power is halved. You can use this ability a number of 
times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. 
Icewalker (Ex) You gain resist cold 10 and can move across snow and icy surfaces without penalty and without 
leaving tracks. You can also climb icy surfaces as if using spider climb. 
Snow Shroud (Su) You ignore concealment and Perception penalties in natural or magical snow, ice, fog, and 
similar weather conditions. In addition, you can surround yourself with a cloak of swirling snow for a 
number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. This power acts and deals damage as a fire shield 
(chill shield) that sheds no light. It provides a 20% miss chance on attacks made against you and grants a 
bonus on Stealth checks equal to ½ your sorcerer level in snowy or icy areas. You can use this ability 
once per day.

Blood Money 
School transmutation; Level magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1 
Casting Time 1 swift action 
Components V, S 
Range 0 ft. 
Effect 1 material component 
Duration Instantaneous 
 
You cast blood money just before casting another spell. As part of this spell’s casting, you must cut one of your 
hands, releasing a stream of blood that causes you to take 1d6 points of damage. When you cast another spell in 
that same round, your blood transforms into one material component of your choice required by that second 
spell. Even valuable components worth more than 1 gp can be created, but creating such material components 
requires an additional cost of 1 point of Strength damage, plus a further point of damage for every full 500 gp of 
the component’s value (so a component worth 500–999 gp costs a total of 2 points, 1,000–1,500 costs 3, etc.). 
You cannot create magic items with blood money. 
 

For example, a sorcerer with the spell stoneskin prepared could cast blood money to create the 250 gp worth of 
diamond dust required by that spell, taking 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of Strength damage in the process. 
 
Material components created by blood money transform back into blood at the end of the round if they have not 
been used as a material component. Spellcasters who do not have blood cannot cast blood money, and those 
who are immune to Strength damage (such as undead spellcasters) cannot use blood money to create valuable 
material components. 
 
This spell initially appears in Paizo’s Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition adventure path. 
 
Helch Barad, the Cold Fortress 
 
Created by Helegûr to serve as a terrifying mobile base of operations, 
Helch Barad is an impenetrable intelligent instant fortress made of 
unmelting ice that turns into a large diamond, rather than a metal 
cube. By themselves, Helch Barad’s walls are as hard and durable as 
adamantine, but they have also been further reinforced by Helegûr’s 
magical treatments with troll’s blood. The crystal tower has the ability 
to fly her and her simulacrum minions wherever she pleases, though 
she most often stays far to the north, where it is said her powers are at 
their strongest. The tower’s crystalline walls also serve as a magical 
scrying device, allowing her to spy upon the outside world from time 
to time. 
Helch Barad was originally a powerful troll mercenary that 
once served as Helegûr’s personal bodyguard. When he betrayed her 
to a higher paying client, she slew him and bound his spirit into her 
newly made fortress—forever ensuring that he would serve as her 
protector. Helegûr continues to keep much of Helch’s regenerative 
flesh on ice within the tower (one of her most prized possessions), 
using it to create numerous simulacrum troll bodyguards which can 
never betray her. In this way, she keeps both Helch’s body and mind 
enslaved to her will as punishment for his treachery. 
Those who oppose Helegûr and the might of her Helch Barad soon find themselves trapped in the midst 
of a great and terrible storm, as the Cold Fortress and its inhabitants rain ice and fire from on high. Victims of 
such wrath are often replaced with simulacrum clones that work endlessly towards Helegûr’s goals abroad. 
The instant fortress, Helch Barad, possesses the following stats: AL CN; Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10; Telepathy; 120 
ft. blindsense; Can fly, as the spell, at a speed of 30 feet (Fly +12 modifier); Can cast scry 3/day and can teleport 
itself and occupants 1/day; Possesses 10 ranks in the fly skill; Ego score 14. Helch Barad possesses double the 
normal hit points and hardness of a normal instant fortress due to magical treatments to its walls.
