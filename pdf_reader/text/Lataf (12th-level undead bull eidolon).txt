Lataf 
“Buurrrn! Reennnd!” 
 
This large abomination looks like some horrible undead conglomeration of man, beetle, and bull. The exposed 
ribs of its torso glow with furnace like heat while its five eyes glow with a vile hatred of life. 
 
In order to be played, Lataf requires a 12
th-level half-elf summoner with the Extra Evolution feat twice and with 
all favored class bonuses going into extra evolution points. A higher level summoner of another race may be 
used, but adjustments to Lataf’s stats may be required (he requires at least 21 Evolution Points).

Link You and your eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as 
you are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing you to give orders to your 
eidolon at any time. What’s more, magic items interfere with this link, so that you and your eidolon 
must share magic item slots. When both you and the eidolon are wearing a magic item in the same slot, 
your magic item continues to function while the eidolon’s becomes dormant. An eidolon must still have 
the appropriate magical item slot in order to be able to use of a given magic item. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your eidolon (as a spell with a range of 
touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your eidolon even if the spells normally do not 
affect creatures of the eidolon’s type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner 
spell list. This ability does not allow your eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they 
function like spells. 
Undead Appearance (Ex) Lataf appears as an undead creature, and mimics some of an undead creature’s 
abilities and weaknesses. Negative energy heals him, and positive energy (including a cleric’s channel 
energy ability) harms him. Spells and effects that target undead or have specific effects against undead 
(such as Command Undead, hold undead, and searing light) affect him as though he were undead. 
Unnatural Aura (Su) Lataf is obviously of unnatural origin. Normal animals do not willingly approach him 
unless the animal’s master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.
