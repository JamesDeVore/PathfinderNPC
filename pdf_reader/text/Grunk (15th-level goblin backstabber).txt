SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Angel of Death (Su) Once per day, when you make a successful death attack, you can cause the target’s body to crumble 
to dust. This prevents raise dead and resurrection (although true resurrection works as normal). You must 
declare the use of this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against 
the death attack, this ability is wasted with no effect. 
Bleeding Attack You can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the 
target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of sneak attack you possess. Bleeding creatures 
take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 
15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does 
not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess. 
Death Attack (Ex) If you study your victim for 3 rounds and then make a sneak attack with a melee weapon that 
successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the 
target (your choice). Studying the victim is a standard action. The death attack fails if the target detects you or 
recognizes you as an enemy (although the attack might still be a sneak attack if the target is denied his Dexterity 
bonus to his Armor Class or is flanked). If the victim of such a death attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 24) against 
the kill effect, they die. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim is rendered helpless and 
unable to act for 1d6+10 rounds. If the victim’s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. 
Once you have completed the 3 rounds of study, you must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a 
death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes their save) or if you do not launch the attack within 3 rounds 
of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before you can attempt another death attack. 
Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a 
successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no 
armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Hidden Weapons (Ex) You add your assassin levels to all Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal weapons on your 
person (included above). 
Hide in Plain Sight (Su) You can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as you are within 10 feet of 
some sort of shadow or an area of dim light, you can hide yourself from view in the open without having anything 
to actually hide behind. You cannot, however, hide in your own shadow. 
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC even if you are caught flat-footed or struck by 
an invisible attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. In addition, you cannot 
be flanked, denying rogues and similar creatures the ability to sneak attack you unless happen to be a rogue (or 
similar character with access to sneak attack) of at least 19th-level. 
Poison Use You are trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison yourself when applying poison to a blade. 
Quiet Death (Ex) Whenever you kill a creature using your death attack during a surprise round, you can also make a 
Stealth check, opposed by the Perception checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them from identifying you as 
the assailant. If successful, those nearby might not even notice that the target is dead for a few moments, allowing 
you to avoid detection. 
Save Bonus against Poison You gain a +5 saving throw bonus against poisons (included above). 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals 8d6 extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC 
(whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flank your target. Should you score a 
critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only 
if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), 
you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. You cannot use a weapon that 
deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be 
able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak 
attack while striking a creature with concealment. 
Still Mind (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects (included above). 
Swift Death (Ex) Once per day, you can make a death attack against a foe without studying the foe beforehand. You must 
still sneak attack your foe using a melee weapon that deals damage. 
True Death (Su) Anyone slain by your death attack becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters 
attempting to bring a creature back from the dead using raise dead or similar magic must make a caster level 
check (DC 25) or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. Casting remove curse the round before 
attempting to bring the creature back from the dead negates this chance. The DC of the remove curse is 20.
