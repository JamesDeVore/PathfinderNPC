SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bleeding Wounds (Su) Whenever a creature takes damage from one of your spells or effects that causes 
negative energy damage (such as inflict light wounds or the death’s touch revelation), it begins to bleed, 
taking 3 points of damage each round. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or any effect 
that heals damage. 
Death’s Touch (Su) You can cause terrible wounds to appear on a creature with a melee touch attack. This 
attack deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage +1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. If 
used against an undead creature, it heals damage and grants a +2 channel resistance for 1 minute. You 
can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. 
Haunted Malevolent spirits follow you wherever you go, causing minor mishaps and strange occurrences (such 
as unexpected breezes, small objects moving on their own, and faint noises). Retrieving any stored item 
from your gear requires a standard action, unless it would normally take longer. Any item you drop 
lands 10 feet away from you in a random direction. 
Near Death (Su) You gain a +4 insight bonus on saves against death effects, diseases, mind-affecting effects, 
poisons, sleep effects, and stunning. 
Raise the Dead (Su) Twice per day, you can summon a single skeleton, bloody skeleton, zombie, or fast 
zombie to serve you as a standard action. The undead creature has a number of Hit Dice equal to your 
oracle level. It remains for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. 
Soul Siphon (Su) As a ranged touch attack, you can unleash a ray that causes a target to gain one negative 
level. The ray has a range of 30 feet. This negative level lasts for a number of minutes equal to your 
Charisma modifier. Whenever this ability gives a target a negative level, you heal a number of hit points 
equal to your oracle level. You can use this ability twice per day. 
Spirit Walk (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can become incorporeal and invisible. While in this 
form, you can move in any direction and through any object (except for those made of force). You can 
take no action other than to move while in this form. You remain in this form for a number of rounds 
equal to your oracle level, but you can end this effect prematurely with a standard action. 
Undead Servitude (Su) You gain Command Undead as a bonus feat. You can channel negative energy a 
number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier, but only to use Command Undead. You 
can take other feats to add to this ability, such as Improved Channeling, but not feats that alter this 
ability, such as Alignment Channel. 
Voice of the Grave (Su) You can speak with dead, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to 
your oracle level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. The dead creature takes a –4 penalty on 
its Will save to resist this effect.
