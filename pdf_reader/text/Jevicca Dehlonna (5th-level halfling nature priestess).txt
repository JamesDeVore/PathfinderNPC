SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Blessing of the Faithful (Su) As a standard action, you can bless one ally within close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 
levels). A blessed ally gains a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, or saving 
throws or to AC until your next turn. You can expend 1 use of channel energy when activating this 
ability to increase the duration to a number of rounds equal to the number of dice of your channel 
energy. 
Bonded Holy Symbol (Su) Your holy symbol functions identically to a wizard’s bonded object except it can be 
used to cast cleric and domain spells (instead of wizard spells) and you can grant your bonded holy 
symbol only magic abilities appropriate for a holy symbol or a neck slot item. As with a wizard’s 
bonded item, you can add additional magic abilities to your bonded holy symbol as if you had the 
required item creation feat (typically Craft Wondrous Item), provided you meet the feat’s level 
prerequisites. The magic properties of a bonded holy symbol, including any magic abilities you added to 
the object, function for only you. If you die or the item is replaced, the object loses all enhancements 
you added using this ability. 

Channel Energy (Su) Seven times per day you may release a burst of positive energy in a 30-ft. radius burst as 
a standard action. When doing so you can choose to harm undead creatures in the area (3d6 damage, 
Will DC 16 half) or to heal the living (3d6 healing). You may exclude up to 3 targets in the area from 
this effect. 
Domain Mastery When you choose your cleric domains, you designate one as your primary domain and the 
other as your secondary domain. You can use your non-domain spell slots to prepare spells from your 
primary domain’s spell list. Each day when you prepare spells, you can select a different domain granted 
by your deity to gain access to that domain’s spell list instead of your secondary domain spell list. You 
do not lose access to your actual secondary domain’s granted powers or gain access to the other 
domain’s granted powers. 
Ecclesitheurge’s Vow You’ve made a vow to your deity to be protected solely by your faith, not by armor or 
shields. An ecclesitheurge who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to use his 
cleric domain powers or cast cleric spells. 
Poison Sassone leaf residue —contact; save Fort DC 16, onset 1 minute, frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes, 
effect 2d12 hp/1 Con, cure 1 save. 
Storm Burst (Sp) As a standard action, you can create a storm burst targeting any foe within 30 feet as a 
ranged touch attack. The storm burst deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 point for every two cleric 
levels you possess. In addition, the target is buffeted by winds and rain, causing it to take a –2 penalty 
on attack rolls for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom 
modifier.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy 
checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a spell with a 
range of touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your animal companion even if the spells 
normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come 
from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities 
that are not spells, even if they function like spells.
