SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Anatomist You have studied the workings of anatomy, either as a student at university or as an apprentice 
mortician or necromancer. You know where to aim your blows to strike vital organs and you gain a +1 
trait bonus on all rolls made to confirm critical hits (which stacks with the +4 from your Crit Focus feat). 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to 
electricity. This also changes the spell’s type to electricity. 
Change Size (Sp) Twice per day, you can magically change a creature’s size. This works just like an enlarge 
person or reduce person spell (you choose when using the ability), except that the ability can work on a 
janni as well. A DC 19 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the 
equivalent of a 2
nd-level spell. 
Elemental Endurance (Ex) You can remain on the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours at a 
time. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes you to take 1 point of 
damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until you die or return to the Material Plane. 
Elemental Ray (Sp) Ten times per day, you can unleash a ray of electricity as a standard action, targeting any 
foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d6+3 electricity damage. 
Spell Critical (Su) Whenever you successfully confirm a critical hit, you can cast a spell as a swift action. The 
spell must include the target of the attack as one of its targets or in its area of effect. Casting this spell 
does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must still meet all of the spell’s components and must 
roll for arcane spell failure if necessary. 
Telepathy (Su) You can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet that has a language. It 
is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic 
conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and 
listening to multiple people at the same time.
