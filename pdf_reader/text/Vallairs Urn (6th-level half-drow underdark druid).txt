SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Cavesense (Ex) Knowledge (dungeoneering) is druid class skill for you, rather than Knowledge (geography). 
Furthermore, you gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Survival checks. 
Cavesight (Sp) You can grant darkvision 60 feet to a willing creature you touch. This effect lasts 1 minute, or 1 
hour if used on yourself. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom 
modifier. 
Light Blindness (Ex) You are blinded for 1 round if exposed to bright light, such as sunlight or the daylight 
spell. You are dazzled for as long as you remain in areas of bright light. 
Lightfoot (Ex) You cannot be detected with tremorsense. 
Resist Subterranean Corruption (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus on saves against exceptional, supernatural, and 
spell-like abilities of oozes and aberrations. 
Silent Hunter You reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving by 5 and can make Stealth checks while 
running at a –20 penalty (this number includes the penalty reduction from this racial trait). 
Tunnelrunner (Ex) You can move through areas of rubble or narrow passages that require squeezing at your 
normal movement rate and without penalty. 

Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). You roll 1d20 and add your druid 
level and your Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic 
animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild 
empathy, you and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, 
influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or 
less time. You can also use this ability to influence an ooze but you take a –4 penalty on the check. 
Wild Shape (Su) You can turn yourself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Your 
options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the beast 
shape I spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until you change back. 
Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. 
The form chosen must be that of an animal with which you are familiar. You lose your ability to speak 
while in animal form because you are limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, 
but you can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as your new form. 
(The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.) 
Additionally, due to your favored class bonuses, you natural armor bonus increases by 2 while wild 
shaped.
