SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Agile Charger (Ex) You take no penalties caused by difficult terrain while charging. Your movement is still 
hampered by obstacles, poor visibility, and other conditions. This ability doesn’t allow you to move 
through impassible terrain. 
Bigger They Are (Ex) You gain a cumulative +1 dodge bonus to AC for every size category a creature is than 
you, to a maximum of +4. 

Challenge (Ex) Five times per day, you can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, you choose one target 
within sight to challenge. Your melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against 
the target of your challenge. This extra damage is equal to your cavalier level. Challenging a foe 
requires much of your concentration causing you to take a –2 penalty to your Armor Class, except 
against attacks made by the target of your challenge. The challenge remains in effect until the target is 
dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. What’s more, you receive an additional +1 morale bonus 
on melee damage rolls against the target of your challenge if it is at least one size category larger than 
you are. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 cavalier levels you have. 
Counterstriking Challenge (Ex) Once per day when you challenge a Large or larger creature, you can also 
prepare to interrupt the creature’s special attacks. The challenged target provokes an attack of 
opportunity from you whenever it activates an extraordinary or a supernatural attack (such as a breath 
weapon or gaze attack).  If you deal damage with this attack, the creature must succeed at a Will save 
(DC = 10 + half your cavalier level + your Charisma modifier) or it fails to activate the special attack 
and loses the action it took to do so. You can perform three such attacks of opportunity over the course 
of a counterstriking challenge. 
Edict You’ve vowed to slay any monster threatening your chosen area. You must fulfill any pledge you make 
to slay a beast, tracking it to its lair if necessary, and forsaking any new quarry until your current target 
is slain. You must attempt to ensure that no lasting damage is dealt to your chosen domain in the pursuit 
of your prey. 
Greater Tactician (Ex) You receive two teamwork feats as bonus feats. You must meet the prerequisites for 
these feats. Three times per day, as a swift action, you can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who 
can see and hear you. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two 
cavalier levels you possess. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. 
Monster Expert (Ex) You gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on Fortitude and Reflex saves against 
abilities and spells that have an area of effect. 
Monster Hunter (Ex) You can attempt Knowledge checks untrained to identify monsters and their weaknesses, 
and you gain a bonus equal to half of your cavalier level on Knowledge checks to identify monsters. 
Pike Charge (Ex) You receive a +4 bonus on melee attacks when charging with a weapon from the polearm or 
spear weapon groups (instead of the normal +2). In addition, you take no penalty to your AC after 
making a charge attack with a polearm or spear. 
Resist Energy (Su) Three times per day as a move action, you can choose one of the following: acid, cold, 
electricity, or fire. You gain energy resistance 15 against the chosen type for 1 minute. 
Skills Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (nature) are class skills for you. In addition, whenever you use a 
Knowledge check to identify a monster, you gain a bonus on your check equal to half your cavalier level 
(minimum +1). 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +5 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using spears, to any combat 
maneuver checks made with spears, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against 
disarm and sunder attempts made against spears. 
  “Blade with whom I have lived, 
blade with whom I now die, 
serve right and justice one last time, 
seek one last heart of evil, 
still one last life of pain. 
Cut well, old friend, 
and then farewell!”
