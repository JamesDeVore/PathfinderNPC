SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bloodline Arcana You use your Intelligence, rather than your Charisma, to determine all class features and 
effects relating to your sorcerer class, such as bonus spells per day, the maximum spell level you can 

cast, the save DCs of your spells, and the number of daily uses of your bloodline powers. You gain a +2 
bonus on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks. 
Metamagic Adept (Ex) You can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell you are about to cast 
without increasing the casting time. You must still expend a higher-level spell slot to cast this spell. You 
can use this ability twice per day.
