SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you cast a spell with the darkness descriptor or the shadow subschool, you gain a 
circumstance bonus on Stealth checks equal to the spell’s level for 1d4 rounds. 
Nighteye (Ex) You have darkvision 30 feet. 
Shadowstrike (Sp) You can make a melee touch attack as a standard action that inflicts 1d4 points of nonlethal damage + 
1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. In addition, the target is dazzled for 1 minute. Creatures with low-
light vision or darkvision are not dazzled by this ability. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal 
to 3 + your Charisma modifier.
