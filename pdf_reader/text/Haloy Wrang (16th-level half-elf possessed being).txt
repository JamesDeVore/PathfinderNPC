SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Arcane Accuracy (Su) You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant yourself an 
insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus on all attack rolls until the end of your turn. 
Arcane Pool (Su) You have a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that you can draw upon to fuel your powers 
and enhance your weapon. This arcane pool has a number of points equal to ½ your magus level 
(minimum 1) + your Intelligence modifier. The pool refreshes once each day when you prepare your 
spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are 
holding a +2 enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with 
existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with 
themselves. These bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, 
flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal. Adding these properties 
consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s cost. These properties are added to any the 
weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement 
bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are 
decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you use this 
ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only 
enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If you use this ability again, the first use immediately ends. 
Broad Study (Ex) You can use your spellstrike and spell combat abilities while casting or using spells from the 
summoner spell list. This does not allow you to cast arcane spells from that class’ spell list without 
suffering the normal chances of arcane spell failure, unless the spell lacks somatic components. 
Esoteric Training Due to your membership in a spellcasting guild (and Fame score of 35+) you gain a +3 
bonus to your caster level with summoner spells and a +1 bonus to your caster level with magus spells 
(up to a maximum of your character level). These bonuses grant you additional spells known and spells 
per day for your modified caster level. 
Fused Eidolon You can wear your eidolon like translucent, living armor. The eidolon mimics all of your 
movements, and you perceive through the eidolon’s senses and speak through its voice, as the two of 
you are now one creature. While fused with your eidolon, you use the eidolon’s Strength, Dexterity, and 
Constitution scores, but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You gain the 
eidolon’s hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the eidolon is killed and sent 
back to its home plane. You use the eidolon’s base attack bonus, and gain the eidolon’s armor and 
natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. You also gain access to the eidolon’s special 
abilities and the eidolon’s evolutions. You are still limited to the eidolon’s maximum number of natural 
attacks. The eidolon has no skills or feats of its own. The eidolon must be at least the same size as you. 
The eidolon must have limbs for you to cast spells with somatic components. The eidolon’s temporary 
hit points can be restored with the rejuvenate eidolon spell. While fused, you lose the benefits of your 
armor. You count both as your original type and as an outsider for any effect related to type, whichever 
is worse for you. Spells such as banishment or dismissal work normally on the eidolon, but you are 
unaffected. Neither you nor your eidolon can be targeted separately, as you are fused into one creature. 
You and your eidolon cannot take separate actions. While fused with your eidolon, you can use all of 
your own abilities and gear, except for your armor. In all other cases, this ability functions as the 
summoner’s normal eidolon ability (for example, you cannot use your summon monster ability while the 
eidolon is present). 
Fused Link (Su) Whenever the temporary hit points from your eidolon would be reduced to 0, you can, as a 
free action, sacrifice any number of your own hit points. Each hit point sacrificed this way prevents 1 

point of damage done to your eidolon (thus preventing the loss of your temporary hit points), preventing 
your eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. 
Improved Spell Combat (Ex) You can cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions 
much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, 
you must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while 
wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all 
of your attacks with your melee weapon at a –2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell 
list with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this 
penalty). If you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack 
rolls, up to your Intelligence bonus, and add that amount +2 as a circumstance bonus on your 
concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can 
choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you 
cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks. 
Knowledge Pool (Su) When you prepare your magus spells, you can decide to expend 1 or more points from 
your arcane pool, up to your Intelligence bonus. For each point you expend, you can treat any one spell 
from the magus spell list as if it were in your spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If 
you do not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time you prepare spells, you lose those spells. 
You can also cast spells added in this way using your spell recall ability, but only until you prepare 
spells again. 
Maker’s Jump (Sp) Whenever you are fused with your eidolon, you can cast dimension door as a spell-like 
ability using your caster level. This ability only affects you and your eidolon. You can use this ability 
only once per day. 
Medium Armor (Ex) You gain proficiency with medium armor. Additionally, you can cast magus spells while 
wearing medium armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane 
spellcaster, a magus wearing heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the 
spell in question has a somatic component. 
Magical Knack Your magus caster level gains a +2 trait bonus as long as this bonus doesn’t raise your caster 
level above your current Hit Dice. 
Multidisciplined The effects of spells you cast from all your classes are calculated as though your caster level 
were 1 level higher, to a maximum of your character level. 
Ongoing Spells You have had greater magic fang (CL 20th) made permanent upon you four times to enhance 
your claw attacks (when you have them). As such, your claw attacks have a +5 enhancement bonus to 
attacks and damage, but can only bypass DR/magic, DR/piercing, or DR/slashing. 
Reactionary You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks. 
Senior Guild Member Using guild contacts, you can earn an additional 10% profit when selling magical 
wondrous items. 
Shielded Meld (Ex) Whenever you are fused with your eidolon, you gain a +2 shield bonus to your Armor 
Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on your saving throws. 
Spell Recall (Su) With a swift action you can recall any single magus spell that you have already prepared and 
cast that day by expending a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the spell’s level 
(minimum 1). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. 
Spellstrike (Su) Whenever you cast a spell with a range of “touch” from the magus spell list, you can deliver 
the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch 
attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, you can make one free melee attack with your weapon (at 
your highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its 
normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, 
this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the 
weapon’s critical range (20, 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar 
effects), but the spell effect only deals ×2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage 
uses its own critical modifier.

Evolutions clawsF (2), flight (wings, +40 ft.), immunity (electricity, fire), large, limbs (armsF, legsF) 
Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, your 
eidolon takes no damage if she makes a successful saving throw. 
Link You and your eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as 
you are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing you to give orders to your 
eidolon at any time. What’s more, magic items interfere with this link, so that you and your eidolon 
must share magic item slots. When both you and the eidolon are wearing a magic item in the same slot, 
your magic item continues to function while the eidolon’s becomes dormant. An eidolon must still have 
the appropriate magical item slot in order to be able to use of a given magic item. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your eidolon (as a spell with a range of 
touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your eidolon even if the spells normally do not 
affect creatures of the eidolon’s type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner 
spell list. This ability does not allow your eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they 
function like spells.
