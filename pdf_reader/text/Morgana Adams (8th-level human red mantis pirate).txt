SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bravado’s Blade (Ex) When you hit an opponent and deal sneak attack damage, you can forgo 1d6 points of 
that damage and make a free Intimidate check to demoralize the foe. For every additional 1d6 points of 
sneak attack damage you forgo, you receive a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. 
Buccaneer’s Blood You gain a +1 trait bonus on Intimidate and Profession (sailor) checks. In addition, you 
gain a one-time +1 trait bonus to your Disrepute and Infamy scores. 
Prayer Attack (Su) You can initiate a prayer attack by holding your sawtooth sabre (or sabres) out, point 
down, and weaving them in the air. You must be within 30 feet of and visible to your victim. Beginning 
a prayer attack is a standard action, and causes your victim to be fascinated by you unless he makes a 
Will save (DC 10 + the Red Mantis assassin class level + your Charisma modifier—if you are wielding 
two sawtooth sabres, this DC gains a +2 bonus). You can maintain the fascination effect by 
concentrating. The victim may attempt a new save to escape fascination each time a threat (other than 
the fascinating assassin) appears. At any point after 3 rounds, she may make a coup de grace attack 
against the target, provided the target is still fascinated. Activating or concentrating on maintaining a 
prayer attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. 
Rake’s Smile (Ex) You gain a +1 morale bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. This bonus increases by +1 
for every 3 rogue levels beyond 3rd. 
Red Shroud (Su) You can create a veil of red mist a number of times per day equal to your Constitution bonus 
(minimum once per day) as a move-equivalent action. The red shroud persists for 1 round per Red 
Mantis Assassin level. It grants a +1 dodge bonus to AC and fast healing equal to your Constitution 
bonus (minimum of fast healing 1). This mist cannot be dissipated by wind. If you are slain while this 
ability is active, you can choose whether to remain corporeal or to disintegrate into a cloud of red mist 
that leaves behind only your gear in order to deprive your enemies of access to your remains. 
Rich Parents You begin play with an additional 900gp to your starting funds. 
Scholastic (Ex) You gain 2 additional skill ranks per fighter level. These ranks must be spent on Intelligence-
based skills. All Intelligence-based skills are class skills for you. You are not proficient in medium 
armor, heavy armor, or shields. 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals 3d6 extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to 
AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flank your target. Should you 
score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as 
sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, 
whip, or an unarmed strike), you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal 
damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, 
not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital 
spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with 
concealment.
