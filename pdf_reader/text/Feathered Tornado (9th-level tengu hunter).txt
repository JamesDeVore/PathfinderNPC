SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Favored Enemy (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival 
checks when using these skills against humans (not included above). Likewise, you get a +4 bonus on 
weapon attack and damage rolls against such creatures. You also get this benefit with Monstrous 
Humanoids, but only at a +2 bonus. 
Favored Terrain (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, 
Stealth, and Survival skill checks when in forest terrain (not included above). You gain similar bonuses 
while in urban environments, albeit only at +2. When traveling through your favored terrain you 
normally leave no trail and cannot be tracked (though you may leave a trail if you so choose). 
Gifted Linguist (Ex) You gain a +4 racial bonus on Linguistics checks, and learn 2 languages each time you 
gain a rank in Linguistics rather than 1 language (included above). 
Swift Tracker (Ex) You may track a target at your full speed without suffering any penalties. 
Swordtrained (Ex) You are automatically proficient with sword-like weapons (including bastard swords, 
daggers, elven curve blades, falchions, greatswords, kukris, longswords, punching daggers, rapiers, 
scimitars, short swords, and two-bladed swords). 
Track (Ex) You add half your ranger levels to Survival checks made to find and follow tracks (included 
above). 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20+7 to determine the wild empathy check result. 
The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually 
unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and the animal must be able to study each other, therefore you 
must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an 
animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. You 
can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you take a  
–4 penalty on the check. 
Woodland Stride (Ex): You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, 
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any 
other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to 
impede motion, however, still affect you.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Constrict (Ex) Trouser can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, when he makes a successful 
grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional 
damage). The amount of damage is given above and is typically equal to Trouser’s bite attack. 
Evasion (Ex) If Trouser makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half 
damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. 
Grab (Ex) If Trouser hits with his bite attack, he deals normal damage and may attempt to start a grapple as a 
free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Trouser may only grab medium creatures in this 
manner. Trouser has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body he 
used in the grab to hold the opponent. If he chooses to do the latter, he takes a –20 penalty on his CMB 
check to make and maintain the grapple, but does not gain the grappled condition himself. If Trouser 
does not constrict, each successful grapple check he makes during successive rounds automatically deals 
the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, he deals constriction damage as 
well (the amount is given above). Creatures with the grab special attack receive a +4 bonus on combat 
maneuver checks made to start and maintain a grapple (included above). 
Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy 
checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding your animal companion. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a spell with a 
range of touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your animal companion even if the spells 
normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come 
from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities 
that are not spells, even if they function like spells.
