SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Battlefield Clarity (Ex) Twice per day, as an immediate action, whenever you fail a saving throw that causes 
you to become blind, deaf, frightened, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, or stunned, you may attempt that 
saving throw again, with a +4 insight bonus on the roll. You must take the second result, even if it is 
worse. 
Clouded Vision Your eyes are obscured, making it difficult for you to see. You cannot see anything beyond 60 
feet, but you can see as if you had blindsense and darkvision. 
Fortune (Ex) As an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll that you have just made before the results 
of the roll are revealed. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it’s worse than the original roll. 
You can use this ability twice per day. 
Lame One of your legs is permanently wounded, reducing your base land speed by 10 feet if your base speed is 
30 feet or more. However, your speed is never reduced due to encumbrance. 
Maneuver Mastery (Ex) When performing the dirty trick combat maneuver, you treat your oracle level as your 
base attack bonus (plus the BAB from other classes) when determining your CMB, you gain the 
Improved Dirty Trick feat, and you gain the Greater Dirty Trick feat. You do not need to meet the 
prerequisites to receive these feats. 
Misfortune (Ex) As an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 feet to reroll any one d20 roll that 
it has just made before the results of the roll are revealed. The creature must take the result of the reroll, 
even if it’s worse than the original roll. Once a creature has suffered from your misfortune, it cannot be 
the target of this revelation again for 1 day. 
Skill At Arms (Ex) You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and heavy armor. 
Weapon Mastery (Ex) You gain Weapon Focus and Improved Critical with the ranseur as bonus feats.
