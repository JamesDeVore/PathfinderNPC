SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Adopted You were adopted and raised by someone not of your actual race, and raised in a society not your own. As a result, you picked up a race 
trait from your adoptive parents and society, and may immediately select a race trait from your adoptive parents’ race. 
Cat’s Luck (Ex) Once per day when you make a Reflex saving throw, you can roll the saving throw twice and take the better result. You must 
decide to use this ability before the saving throw is attempted. 
Eye for Plunder You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Perception checks to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps). In 
addition, you begin the campaign with a selection of mundane trade goods worth 50gp that you were able to scrounge together during your 
first day on the Wormwood. 
Goldsniffer Your keen senses lead you to hidden treasures. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Perception checks related to metals, jewels, and gemstones. 
Grit (Ex) At the start of each day, you gain a number of grit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Your grit goes up or down 
throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), though some feats and magic items may affect 
this maximum. You spend grit to accomplish deeds (see below), and regain grit in the following ways. 
  Critical Hit with a Firearm: Each time you confirm a critical hit with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, you regain 1 grit 
point. Confirming a critical hit on a helpless or unaware creature or on a creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level does 
not restore grit. 
  Killing Blow with a Firearm: When you reduce a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm attack while in the heat of combat, 
you regain 1 grit point. Destroying an unattended object, reducing a helpless or unaware creature to 0 or fewer hit points, or reducing a 
creature that has fewer Hit Dice than half your character level to 0 or fewer hit points does not restore any grit. 
Gunslinger’s Dodge (Ex) When a ranged attack is made against you, you can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so 
grants you a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. 
Alternatively, you may drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. You can only perform this deed while wearing 
medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load. 
Gunslinger Initiative (Ex) As long as you have at least 1 grit point, you gain the following benefits: First, you gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. 
Furthermore, if you have the Quick Draw feat, your hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, you can draw a single 
firearm as part of the initiative check. 
Nimble (Ex) You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes you to lose your Dexterity bonus to AC also 
causes you to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd-level (to a maximum of +5 at 20th-level). 
Pistol Training (Ex) You gain a bonus on damage rolls equal to your Dexterity modifier with one-handed firearms, and when you misfire with a 
one-handed firearm, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4. Every four levels of gunslinger thereafter (9th, 13
th, and 17th), the bonus 
on damage rolls increases by +1. At 13th level, you never misfire with a one-handed firearm. 
Pistol-Whip (Ex) You can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of your firearm as a standard action. When you do, you are 
considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gain a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement 
bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-
handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by size Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage 
(1d8 if wielded by size Small creatures). Regardless of your size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/×2. If the attack hits, you can 
make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point. 
Quick Clear (Ex) As a standard action, you can remove the broken condition from a single firearm you are currently wielding, as long as that 
condition was gained by a firearm misfire. You must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if you spend 1 grit point 
to perform this deed, you can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action. 
Up Close and Deadly (Ex) When you fire upon a target with a one-handed firearm that is not making a scatter shot, you can spend 1 grit point to 
deal 2d6 points of extra damage on a hit. If you miss with the attack, you graze the target, dealing half the extra damage anyway. You must 
choose to spend the grit point before you make the attack roll. This is precision damage and is not multiplied if the attack is a critical hit. 
This precision damage stacks with sneak attack and other forms of precision damage. 
Utility Shot (Ex) If you have at least 1 grit point, you can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single 
attack with a firearm, but you must declare the utility shot you are using before firing the shot. 
•  Blast Lock: You make an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of your firearm. A Diminutive lock usually 
has AC 7, and larger locks have lower ACs. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple 
lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has 
a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the 
object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered 
locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, 
though the DC or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer 
works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that 
spell. 
•  Scoot Unattended Object: You make an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of 
your firearm. A Tiny unattended object has AC 5, a Diminutive unattended object has AC 7, and a Fine unattended object has AC 
11. On a hit, you do not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot’s origin. On a 
miss, you damage the object normally. 
•  Stop Bleeding: You make a firearm attack and then press the hot barrel against an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. 
Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. You do not have to make an attack roll 
when performing the deed in this way; you can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition 
normally.
