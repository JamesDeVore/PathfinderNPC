SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Aura of Courage (Su) You are immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of you gains a 
+4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while you are 
conscious, not if you are unconscious or dead. 
Aura of Good (Ex) You possess a strong aura of good at all times. 
Channel Positive Energy (Su) By expending two uses of your lay on hands ability, you may release a burst of 
positive energy in a 30-ft. radius burst as a standard action. When doing so you can choose to harm 

undead creatures in the area (4d6 damage, Will DC 14 half) or to heal the living (4d6 healing). You may 
exclude up to 3 targets in the area from this effect. 
Detect Evil (Sp) At will, you can use detect evil, as the spell. You can, as a move action, concentrate on a 
single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, learning the strength of its aura as if 
having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, you do not detect evil in any 
other object or individual within range. 
Divine Bond (Sp) Once per day you may enhance a weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a 
celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light as a 
torch. This spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. This bonus can be added to the weapon, 
stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the 
following weapon properties: axiomatic, brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, flaming burst, 
holy, keen, merciful, and speed. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the 
property’s cost modifier. These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but 
duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be 
added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are 
determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial 
spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than you but resumes giving bonuses if 
returned to you. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. If a weapon bonded with a 
celestial spirit is destroyed, you lose the use of this ability for 30 days, or until you gain a level, 
whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, you take a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage 
rolls. 
Divine Grace (Su) You gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on all saving throws (included above). 
Divine Health (Ex) You are immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases. 
Lay On Hands (Su) Five times per day, you can heal wounds (your own or those of others) by touch. With one 
use of this ability, you can heal 3d6 points of damage. Using this ability is a standard action, unless you 
target herself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the name of this ability, you only need one free 
hand to use this ability. Alternatively, you can use this healing power to deal damage to undead 
creatures, dealing 3d6 points of damage. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee 
touch attack and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against 
this damage. 
Mercy (Su) When you use your lay on hands ability to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the 
additional effects from all of your mercies (shown below). A mercy can remove a condition caused by a 
curse, disease, or poison without curing the affliction. Such conditions return after 1 hour unless the 
mercy actually removes the affliction that causes the condition. Your mercies allow you to remove the 
following conditions: disease and fatigue. 
Smite Evil (Su) Three times per day, as a swift action, you can choose one target within sight to smite. If this 
target is evil, you add your Charisma bonus to your attack rolls and add your paladin level to all damage 
rolls made against the target of your smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, 
an evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack 
increases to 2 points of damage per paladin level you possess. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks 
automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite evil is in effect, you 
gain a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to your AC against attacks made by the target 
of the smite. If you target a creature that is not evil, your smite is wasted with no effect. The smite evil 
effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time you rest and regain your uses of this 
ability.
