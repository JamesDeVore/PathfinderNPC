SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Abnormal Reach (Su) Your reach increases by 5 feet during your bloodrage. 

Blood Casting (Su) You cast spells even while bloodraging. You can also cast these spells defensively and can 
make concentration checks for these spells while bloodraging. While bloodraging, you can cast and 
concentrate on only your bloodrager spells; spells from other classes cannot be cast during this state. 
Blood Sanctuary (Su) You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells that you or an ally casts. 
Bloodrage (Su) You can bloodrage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At 
each bloodrager level after 1
st, you can bloodrage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases 
to Constitution (such as those gained from bloodraging or spells like bear’s endurance) don’t increase 
the total number of rounds that you can bloodrage per day. The total number of rounds of bloodrage per 
day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive. You can enter a 
bloodrage as a free action. While in a bloodrage, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength and 
Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, you take a –2 penalty to Armor 
Class. The increase to Constitution grants you 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these disappear when the 
bloodrage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While bloodraging, you cannot use any 
Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any 
ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end your bloodrage as a free action. When the 
bloodrage ends, you’re fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in the 
bloodrage. You cannot enter a new bloodrage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter 
bloodrage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your bloodrage 
immediately ends, placing you in peril of death. Bloodrage counts as the barbarian’s rage class feature 
for the purpose of feat prerequisites, feat abilities, magic item abilities, and spell effects. 
Fast Movement (Ex) Your land speed is faster than is normal for your race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only 
when you are wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply 
this bonus before modifying your speed due to any armor worn or load carried. This bonus stacks with 
any other bonuses to your land speed. 
Orc Blood You count as both a human and an orc for any effect related to race. 
Staggering Strike (Su) When you confirm a critical hit during a bloodrage, the target must succeed a Fortitude 
saving throw (DC = 10 + ½ your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier) or be staggered for 1 
round. These effects stack with the Staggering Critical feat. The target must save against each effect 
individually. 
Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You cannot be caught flat-footed, nor do you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if the 
attacker is invisible. You still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. You can still lose your 
Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against you. 
Weapon Familiarity You are always proficient with greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the 
word “orc” in its name as a martial weapon.
