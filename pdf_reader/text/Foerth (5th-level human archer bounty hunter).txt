Foerth 
“Oh I just love killin’ bandits!” 
 
Lost in the wild as a child, Foerth was found and raised by fey-creatures 
known as spriggans. The spriggans, an evil and violent lot, spent many 
years trying to warp the boy’s mind in an attempt to make him more 
like them. They only partially succeeded. Though his unusual 
childhood made him quite crazy, Foerth’s human nature proved to 
be quite enduring and he never truly fell into the depraved habits 
and rituals common to the vile spriggans. Due to a never ending 
series of cruel tricks and abuse by his adoptive family, Foerth became 
incredibly tough and learned much about survival in the wild, though 
he also became insensate. 
 
One day a large group of bandits found the spriggan tribe and 
attacked them in hopes of stealing their ill-gotten spoils. The 
spriggans, being violent cut throats themselves, managed to 
repel the invaders with their magic and potent martial abilities, 
but not before the bandits discovered and captured Foerth. The 
surviving bandits took Foerth to Issia in Northern Brevoy, 
where he was forced to spend a number of years in academies and institutions that attempted to reform him. 
They only partially succeeded. Foerth learned to read and write in the common language, and he gained much 
needed experience in the ways of the civilized world, but his disquieting personality remained almost 
completely unchanged. 
 
Eventually, Foerth escaped from the institutions and returned to the wild in hopes of finding his way back to his 
“family.” The once small world, however, proved to have grown much too large for him and he had no idea 
where his former home now lay. After going through a terrible and uncharacteristic bout of depression, Foerth’s 
new maelstrom of emotion turned to one of anger and rage. He turned it against those who had ruined his life: 
the bandits and highwaymen of the River Kingdoms. 
 
Foerth became a bounty hunter who specialized in finding and destroying criminals who would hide in the wild. 
His talents as an effective tracker and manslayer grew in infamy until they nearly rivaled the dark rumors of his 
strange and unusual past. He was last seen traveling into the Stolen Lands far to the South as part of an 
expedition to rid the region of criminal activity and reopen long lost trade routes.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Favored Enemy (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival 
checks when using these skills against humans. Likewise, you get a +4 bonus on weapon attack and 
damage rolls against them. You may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to 
identify these creatures. You gain similar bonuses with Fey, but only at a +2 bonus. 
Favored Terrain (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, 
Stealth, and Survival skill checks when in forest terrain (not included above). When traveling through 
your favored terrain you normally leave no trail and cannot be tracked (though you may leave a trail if 
you so choose). 

Hunter’s Bond (Ex) You have formed a close bond with an animal companion. This animal is a loyal 
companion that accompanies you on your adventures as appropriate for its kind. Your animal 
companion shares your favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses. This ability functions like the druid 
animal companion ability (which is part of the Nature Bond class feature), except that the ranger’s 
effective druid level is equal to his ranger level –3. 
Magical Knack Your caster level in the Ranger class gains a +2 trait bonus as long as this bonus doesn’t 
increase your caster level to higher than your current Hit Dice (included above). 
Pioneer You gain a +1 trait bonus on all checks made with the Ride skill. 
Track (Ex) You add half your ranger levels to Survival checks made to find and follow tracks. 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check made to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your ranger level and your 
Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a 
starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and 
the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an 
animal in this manner takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. 
You can also use this ability to influence a 
magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, 
but you take a –4 penalty on the check. 
 
RANGER’S KIT 
This includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint 
and steel, iron pot, mess kit, rope, torches (10), trail 
rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 

Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy 
checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a spell with a 
range of touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your animal companion even if the spells 
normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come 
from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities 
that are not spells, even if they function like spells. 
Stampede (Ex) A stampede occurs if three or more creatures with stampede make a trample attack while 
remaining adjacent to each other. While stampeding, the creatures can trample foes of their size or 
smaller, and the trample’s save DC increases by +2. 
Stench (Ex) A creature with the stench special ability secretes an oily chemical that nearly every other creature 
finds offensive. All living creatures (except those with the stench special ability) within 30 feet must 
succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + ½ stench creature’s racial HD + stench creature’s Con modifier; 
the exact DC is given in the creature's descriptive text) or be sickened. The duration of the sickened 
condition is given in the creature’s descriptive text. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected 
by the same creature’s stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect 
from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to 
poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. 
Trample (Ex) As a full-round action, a creature with the trample ability can attempt to overrun any creature 
that is at least one size category smaller than itself. This works just like the overrun combat maneuver, 
but the trampling creature does not need to make a check, it merely has to move over opponents in its 
path. Targets of a trample take an amount of damage equal to the trampling creature’s slam damage + 
1½ times its Str modifier. Targets of a trample can make an attack of opportunity, but at a –4 penalty. If 
targets forgo an attack of opportunity, they can attempt to avoid the trampling creature and receive a 
Reflex save to take half damage. The save DC against a creature’s trample attack is 10 + ½ creature’s 
HD + creature’s Str modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature’s descriptive text). A trampling 
creature can only deal trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its 
movement takes it over a target creature.
