 SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Esoteric Training Due to your membership in a spellcasting guild (and Fame score of 35+) you gain a +3 
bonus to your caster level with druid spells and a +1 bonus to your caster level with ranger spells (up 
to a maximum of your character level). These bonuses grant you additional spells known and spells 
per day for your modified caster level. 
Fast Movement (Ex) Your land speed is faster than the norm for your race by +10 feet. This benefit applies 
only when you are wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. 
Apply this bonus before modifying your speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus 
stacks with any other bonuses to your land speed. 
Guarded Life (Ex) While raging, if you are reduced below 0 hit points, 1 hit point of lethal damage per 
barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. If you are at negative hit points due to lethal 
damage, you immediately stabilize. 
Lesser Beast Totem (Su) While raging, you gain two claw attacks. These attacks are considered primary 
attacks and are made at your full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d6 points of slashing damage 
plus your Strength modifier. 
Nature Sense (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus to knowledge: nature checks and Survival checks (included above). 
Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural 
abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as blight, 
entangle, spike growth, and warp wood. 
Senior Guild Member Using guild contacts, you can earn an additional 10% profit when selling magical 
wondrous items. 
Trackless Step (Ex) You leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. You may choose to 
leave a trail if so desired. 
Trap Sense (Ex) You gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC 
against attacks made by traps. 
Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. You still lose your 
Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized or when an opponent successfully uses the feint action against 
you. 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check made to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your druid level and your 
Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a 
starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you 
and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing 
an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. 
Additionally, you may also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 
or 2, but you take a –4 penalty on the check. 
Wild Shape (Su) You have the ability to turn yourself into a variety of creatures and back again four times 
per day. Your options for new forms include animals of Diminutive to Huge size, elementals of Small 
to Large size, and plant creatures of Small to Large size. This ability functions like the beast shape III 
spell (for animals), the elemental body III spell (for elementals) or as the plant shape II spell (for plant 
creatures), except as noted here. The effect lasts for 10 hours, or until you change back. Changing 
form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form 
chosen must be that of an animal, elemental, or plant creature with which you are familiar. You can 
communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as your new form. 
Woodland Stride (Ex) You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, 
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering 
any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to 
impede motion, however, still affect you.

 SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Devotion (Ex) Your animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells 
and effects (included above). 
Evasion (Ex) If your animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half 
damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw. 
Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild 
empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding your animal companion. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a spell with a 
range of touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your animal companion even if the 
spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must 
come from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share 
abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.
