SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Mirror Move (Ex) You gain your weapon training bonus as an insight bonus to AC when attacked by rocks or 
rock-like objects. 
Prismati Player You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls with fist sized rocks or similarly shaped objects, and a 
+1 trait bonus on concentration checks. 
Rage (Ex) You can enter a rage as a free action for 12 rounds each day. The total number of rounds of rage per 
day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in 
rage, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on 
Will saves. In addition, you take a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you 2 
hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit 
points. While in rage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except 
Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end 
your rage as a free action and you become fatigued afterwards for a number of rounds equal to 2 times 
the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can 

otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your 
rage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death. 
Reliable Strike (Ex) You may reroll an attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, miss chance check, or damage 
roll with a rock as an immediate action. You must accept the second roll even if it is worse. You can use 
this ability twice per day. 
Rock Throwing (Ex) You have a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with thrown rocks. You can hurl rocks up to 
two categories smaller than your own size. The range increment for a rock is 20 feet, and you can hurl it 
up to 5 range increments. Base damage for a hurled rock is 2d4 for a Medium creature, plus 1½ your 
Strength bonus. 
Skilled Thrower (Ex) Increase the range increment of any thrown weapon or object by 10 feet. 
Strong Arm, Supple Wrist Whenever you move at least 10 feet before making an attack with a thrown 
weapon, you add 10 feet to the range increment of the weapon thrown. 
Wasting (Ex) You take a –4 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks, except for Intimidate. You gain a +4 
competence bonus on saves made against disease and are immune to the sickened condition. 
Weapon Guard (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus to CMD against disarm and sunder attempts while wielding rocks. 
This bonus also applies on saves against any effect that targets your rocks. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls with rocks.
