SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Accursed Strike (Sp) You can deliver any prepared spell with the curse descriptor using the spellstrike ability, 
even if the spells are not touch attack spells. Spells with the curse descriptor are denoted by a dagger 
above. 
Arcane Accuracy (Su) You can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant yourself an 
insight bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus on all attack rolls until the end of your turn. 
Arcane Pool (Su) You have a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that he can draw upon to fuel his powers and 
enhance your weapon. This arcane pool has a number of points equal to ½ your magus level (minimum 
1) + your Intelligence modifier. The pool refreshes once each day when you prepare your spells. You 
can expend 1 point from your arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon you are holding a +4 
enhancement bonus for 1 minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing 
weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. This ability counts as the Arcane Strike feat for meeting any 
prerequisites. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves. These bonuses can be used to 
add any of the following weapon properties: dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, 
shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to 
the property’s cost. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not 
stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other 
properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent 
and cannot be changed until the next time you use this ability. These bonuses do not function if the 
weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. 
If you use this ability again, the first use immediately ends. 
Dispelling Strike (Su) You can spend 1 or more points from your arcane pool as a swift action to imbue your 
weapon with a special power. If the weapon strikes a creature within the next minute, that creature is the 
subject of a targeted dispel magic using your magus level as the caster level, except that this effect 
cannot dispel a spell of a level higher than the number of arcane pool points expended to activate this 
ability (treat higher-level spells as if they do not exist and apply the dispel attempt to the remaining 
spells with the highest caster level). Once the strike is made, the power dissipates, even if the dispel 
attempt is unsuccessful. 
Evil Eye (Su) You can cause doubt to creep into the mind of a foe within 30 feet that you can see. The target 
takes a –4 penalty on one of the following (your choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, 
or skill checks. This hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. A Will 
save reduces this to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. 
Fighter Training (Ex) You count ½ your total magus level as your fighter level for the purpose of qualifying 
for feats. If you have levels in fighter, these levels stack. 
Greater Spell Combat (Ex) You can cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions much 
like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, you 
must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding 
a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your 
attacks with your melee weapon at a –2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with 
a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If 
you cast this spell defensively, you can decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to 
your Intelligence bonus, and add twice that amount +2 as a circumstance bonus on your concentration 
check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast 

the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the 
spell between weapon attacks. 
Hex Magus (Su) You gain access to a small number of witch’s hexes (shown above). 
Knowledge Pool (Su) When you prepare your magus spells, you can decide to expend 1 or more points from 
your arcane pool, up to your Intelligence bonus. For each point you expend, you can treat any one spell 
from the magus spell list as if it were in your spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If 
you do not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time you prepares spells, you loses those 
spells. 
Medium/Heavy Armor (Ex) You can cast magus spells while wearing armor without incurring the normal 
arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, when using a shield you incur a chance of 
arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. 
Reflection (Su) You can sacrifice 1 or more points from your arcane pool as an immediate action to reflect a 
spell back at its caster. This functions as spell turning, but only if the targeted spell is of a level equal to 
or less than the number of points expended. If insufficient points are expended, they instead grant an 
insight bonus on any saving throws allowed by the spell, equal to the number of points spent. 
Spell Blending (Ex) You treat one or more wizard spells (shown above) as magus spells. You know them for 
free. These spells are marked by double daggers above. 
Spell Shield (Su) You can expend a point from your arcane pool as an immediate action to grant yourself a 
shield bonus to AC equal to your Intelligence bonus until the end of your next turn. 
Spellstrike (Su) Whenever you cast a spell with a range of “touch” from the magus spell list, you can deliver 
the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch 
attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, you can make one free melee attack with your weapon (at 
your highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its 
normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, 
this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the 
weapon’s critical range (20, 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar 
effects), but the spell effect only deals ×2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage 
uses its own critical modifier.
