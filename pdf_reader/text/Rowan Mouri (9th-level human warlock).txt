SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Death’s Gift (Su) You gain resist cold 10 and DR 10/– against nonlethal damage. 
Grasp of the Dead (Sp) You can cause a swarm of skeletal arms to burst from the ground to rip and tear at 
your foes. The skeletal arms erupt from the ground in a 20-foot-radius burst. Anyone in this area takes 
1d6 points of slashing damage per sorcerer level. Those caught in the area receive a Reflex save for half 
damage. Those who fail the save are unable to move for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + ½ 
your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. The skeletal arms disappear after 1 round. The arms must 
burst up from a solid surface. This power has a range of 60 feet. 
Grave Touch (Sp) You can make a melee touch attack as a standard action that causes a living creature to 
become shaken for a number of rounds equal to ½ your sorcerer level (minimum 1). If you touch a 
shaken creature with this ability, it becomes frightened for 1 round if it has fewer Hit Dice than your 
sorcerer level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Quick Strikes (Ex) Whenever a fast zombie takes a full-attack action, it can make one additional slam attack at 
its highest base attack bonus (included above). 
Undead Traits (Ex) Undead are immune to death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects (charms, 
compulsions, morale effects, phantasms, and patterns), paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and any effect that 
requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). Undead are not subject 
to ability drain, energy drain, or nonlethal damage. Undead are immune to damage or penalties to their 
physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution), as well as to fatigue and exhaustion 
effects. Undead are not at risk of death from massive damage.
