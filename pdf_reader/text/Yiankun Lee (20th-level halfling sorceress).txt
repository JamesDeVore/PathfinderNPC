 SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Arcane Apotheosis (Ex) You can add any metamagic feats that you know to your spells without increasing their casting time, 
although you must still expend higher-level spell slots. Whenever you use magic items that require charges, you can 
instead expend spell slots to power the item. For every three levels of spell slots that you expend, you consume one less 
charge when using a magic item that expends charges. 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you apply a metamagic feat to a spell that increases the slot used by at least one level, increase the 
spell’s DC by +1. This bonus does not stack with itself and does not apply to spells modified by the Heighten Spell feat. 
Flesh to Stone Your flesh to stone spell has a DC of 37 and a caster level of 27 (or 35 for overcoming spell resistance) when cast 
with any metamagic feat. 
Ongoing Spells The following spells are regularly active upon your person: ant haul, false life, freedom of movement (from wand), 
heroism (extended), mage armor, mind blank, moment of presence, overland flight, protection from energy (extended; 
acid, cold, electricity, fire), see invisibility, shapechange, spell turning, and statue. Excepting freedom of movement, all 
ongoing spell effects function at 21st-caster level (and thus require a DC 32 caster level check to dispel) and their effects 
are included in the above stats where appropriate. Additionally, you have used wish to add a +5 inherent bonus to your 
Charisma score, and a +4 inherent bonus to your Constitution score. You have also used wish to grant yourself the ability 
to teleport your personal gear back to you should it ever be parted from you for any reason and limited wish to make all of 
your clone bodies into stone statues that are each as tough as adamantine (which still come to life at the appropriate time). 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with slings and treat any weapon with the word “halfling” in its name as a martial weapon.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Alertness (Ex) While your familiar is within arm’s reach, you gain the Alertness feat. 
Deliver Touch Spells (Su) If you and your familiar are in contact at the time you cast a touch spell, you can designate your familiar 
as the toucher. Your familiar can then deliver the touch spell personally. As usual, if you cast another spell before the 
touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. 
Empathic Link (Su) Your familiar has an empathic link with you out to one mile. You cannot see through your familiar’s eyes, but 
the two of you can communicate empathically. Only general emotional content can be communicated. You have the same 
connection to an item or place that your familiar does. 
Improved Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, your familiar 
takes no damage if he makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails. 
Scry On Familiar (Sp) Once per day you may scry on your familiar, as if using the scry spell. 
Share Spells You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your familiar (as a touch spell) instead of on yourself. You may cast 
spells on your familiar even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of your familiar’s type (magical beast). 
Speak with Rodents (Ex) Your familiar may communicate with other rodents. Such communication is limited by the Intelligence 
of the conversing creatures. 
Speak With Master (Ex) You and your familiar may communicate verbally, using a private language no one else understands.
