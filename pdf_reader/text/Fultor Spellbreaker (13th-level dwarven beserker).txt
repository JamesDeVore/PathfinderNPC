SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Defensive Training You gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by Giants (not included above). 
Greater Guarded Life (Ex) While raging, if you are reduced below 0 hit points, 2 hit points of lethal damage 
per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. If you are at negative hit points due to lethal 
damage, you immediately stabilize. 
Greed You gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise skill checks made to determine the price of nonmagical goods 
that contain precious metals or gemstones (not included above). 
Hatred You receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against Humanoid creatures of the Orc and Goblinoid subtypes 
due to special training against these hated foes (not included above). 
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. You still 
lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. You can still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if an 
opponent successfully uses the feint action against you. Additionally, you cannot be flanked (denying 
rogues their sneak attack), but by a character who possesses improved uncanny dodge and is four levels 
higher than yourself. 
Magic Resistant You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level. This resistance can be lowered for 
1 round as a standard action. You take a –2 penalty on all concentration checks made in relation to 
arcane spells. 
Overbearing Advance (Ex) While raging, you inflict damage equal to your Strength bonus whenever you 
succeed at an overrun combat maneuver. 
Rage (Ex) You can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + your Constitution modifier + 2 rounds per 
barbarian level after 1st. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from rage and spells 
like bear’s endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that you can rage per day. Entering a 
rage is a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, 
although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in rage, you gain a +6 morale bonus to your 
Strength and Constitution, as well as a +3 morale bonus on Will saves. In addition, you take a –2 penalty 
to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear 
when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in rage, you cannot use any 
Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any 
ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end your rage as a free action and are fatigued 
after rage for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot 
enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single 
encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your rage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death. 
Relentless You receive a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver checks made to bull rush or overrun an opponent. 
This bonus only applies while both you and your opponent are standing on the ground. 
Rock Stepper You can skillfully negotiate rocky terrain. You ignore difficult terrain created by rubble, broken 
ground, or steep stairs when you take a 5-foot step. 
Skilled Thrower (Ex) You are skilled at throwing objects in combat. Increase the range increment of any 
thrown weapon or object by 10 feet. 
Strength Surge (Ex) You add your barbarian level on one Strength check or combat maneuver check, or to 
your Combat Maneuver Defense when an opponent attempts a maneuver against you. This power is 
used as an immediate action. This power can only be used once per rage. 

Superstition (Ex) You gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws made to resist spells, supernatural abilities, 
and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 barbarian levels you have attained. While 
raging, you cannot be a willing target of any spell and must make saving throws to resist all spells, even 
those cast by allies. 
Trap Sense (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +4 dodge bonus to AC against 
attacks made by traps. 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with battleaxes, heavy picks, and warhammers, and treat any weapon 
with the word “dwarven” in its name as a martial weapon. 
Witch Hunter (Ex) While raging, you gain a +1 bonus on damage rolls against creatures possessing spells or 
spell-like abilities. This damage bonus increases by +1 for every four levels of barbarian you have 
obtained.
