SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Fast Movement (Ex) You gain a +10 ft. bonus to your land speed (included above). You lose this extra speed if 
in heavy armor or carrying a heavy load. 
No Escape (Ex) You can move up to double her normal speed as an immediate action but you can only use this 
ability when an adjacent foe uses a withdraw action to move away from you. You must end your 
movement adjacent to the enemy that used the withdraw action. You provoke attacks of opportunity as 
normal during this movement. This power can only be used once per rage. 
Orc Blood You count as both a human and an orc for any effect related to race. 
Orc Ferocity (Ex) Once per day, when you are brought below 0 hit points but not killed, you can fight on for 
one more round as if disabled. At the end of your next turn, unless brought to above 0 hit points, you 
immediately fall unconscious and begin dying. 
Rage (Ex) You can enter a rage as a free action for 6 rounds each day. The total number of rounds of rage per 
day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in 
rage, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on 
Will saves. In addition, you take a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you 2 
hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit 

points. While in rage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except 
Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end 
your rage as a free action and you become fatigued afterwards for a number of rounds equal to 2 times 
the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can 
otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your 
rage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death. 
Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC even if you are caught flat-footed or struck by an 
invisible attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. 
Weapon Familiarity You are always proficient with greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the 
word “orc” in its name as a martial weapon.
