SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Evasion (Ex) If exposed to any effect that normally allows you to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, you take no damage with a successful saving throw. The evasion ability can only be used if you 
are wearing light armor or no armor. 
Favored Enemy (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival 
checks against humans. Likewise, you gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. 
You may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures. 

Hide in Plain Sight (Su) You can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as you are within 10 
feet of an area of dim light, you can hide yourself from view in the open without anything to actually 
hide behind. You cannot, however, hide in your own shadow. 
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You can react to danger before your senses would normally allow her to do 
so. You cannot be caught flat-footed, nor do you lose your Dex bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. 
You still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. You can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC 
if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against you. Additionally, you can no longer be flanked. 
This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack you by flanking you, unless the attacker has at 
least four more rogue levels than you have ninja and shadow dancer levels. 
Ki Pool (Su) You have a pool of ki points, supernatural energy you can use to accomplish amazing feats. The 
number of points in your ki pool is equal to ½ your ninja level + your Charisma modifier. As long as 
you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, you treat any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if you had 
a running start. By spending 1 point from your ki pool, you can make one additional attack at your 
highest attack bonus, but you can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, you can spend 1 
point to increase your speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to 
give yourself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth skill checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as 
a swift action. You can gain additional powers that consume points from your ki pool by selecting 
certain ninja tricks. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these 
hours do not need to be consecutive. 
No Trace (Ex) You learn to cover your tracks, remain hidden, and conceal your presence. The DC to track you 
using the Survival skill increases by +1. In addition, your training gives you a +1 insight bonus on 
Disguise skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever you are stationary and do not take any 
action for at least 1 round. 
Poison Use You are trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison yourself when applying poison 
to a weapon. 
Poison Black adder venom—injury; save Fort DC 11, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d2 Con, cure 1 
save. 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals 2d6 extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to 
AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flank your target. This bonus 
damage is considered precision damage. Should you score a critical hit with precision damage is not 
multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon 
that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), you can make a sneak attack that 
deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to 
deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be able to see the 
target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak 
attack while striking a creature with concealment. 
Track (Ex) You gain a +1 bonus to Survival checks to made to follow or identify tracks (included above). 
Vanishing Trick (Su) As a swift action, you can disappear for 1 round per level. This ability functions as 
invisibility. Using this ability uses up 1 ki point. 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a 
Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your ranger level and 
Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting 
attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and the 
animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing 
an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. 
You can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you 
take a –4 penalty on the check.
