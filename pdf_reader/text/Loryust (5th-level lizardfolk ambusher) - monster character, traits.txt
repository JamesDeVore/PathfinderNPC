SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Favored Terrain (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, 
Stealth, and Survival skill checks when in forest terrain (not included above). When traveling through 
your favored terrain you normally leave no trail and cannot be tracked (though you may leave a trail if 
you so choose). 
Indomitable Faith You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves (included above). 
Poison Trap (Ex or Su) This trap poisons the creature that triggers it. If it is a supernatural trap, the poison 
deals 1d2 Con damage per round for 6 rounds. If it is an extraordinary trap, you must provide 1 dose of 
contact, inhaled, or injury poison when setting the trap, and the trap uses that poison’s effects and DC. 
Ranger’s Focus (Ex) Twice per day you can focus on a single enemy within line of sight as a swift action. That 
creature remains your focus until it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or surrenders, or until you a new 

focus, whichever occurs first. You gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the target of your 
focus. 
Snare Trap (Ex or Su) This trap constricts around a limb or other part of the triggering creature’s body (Reflex 
avoids). The creature cannot move from the location of the trap, unless you include a “leash” when 
setting the trap, in which case the creature is limited to the length of the leash. The trapped creature can 
escape with an Escape Artist check (DC equal to the trap’s DC) as a full-round action. The trap or its 
leash has a number of hit points equal to ½ your ranger level, or can be burst as a full-round action with 
a DC 25 Strength check. The trap can hold up to a Medium creature; each extra daily use of your trap 
ability spent when the trap is set increases the maximum size of creature the trap can hold. At your 
option, if there is a tall object or structure nearby, you can have the trap lift the creature. 
Swamp Skulker You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks when you are in bog, marsh, or swamp terrain, 
and you treat shallow bogs and swamp undergrowth as normal terrain for the purposes of movement. 
Terrain Bond (Ex) When in your favored terrain, you grant all allies within line of sight and that can hear you 
a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. Also, as long as they 
travel with you, your allies leave no trail and can’t be tracked. You can choose for the group to leave a 
trail, or even specific members of the group to leave a trail if you so desire. 
Track (Ex) You add half your ranger levels to Survival checks made to find and follow tracks. 
Trapfinding You add ½ your ranger level on Perception skill checks made to locate traps and on Disable 
Device skill checks (minimum +1). You can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check made to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your ranger level and your 
Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a 
starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and 
the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an 
animal in this manner takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. 
You can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you 
take a –4 penalty on the check.
