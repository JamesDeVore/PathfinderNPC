SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Contingency Should you ever become grievously wounded (fall below 25 hit points), you are immediately 
teleported (as per the spell) to a nearby allied temple. 
Elemental Wall (Sp) You can create a wall of energy that lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to your 
wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This wall deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire 
damage, determined when you create it. The elemental wall otherwise functions like wall of fire. 
Force Missile (Sp) As a standard action you can unleash a force missile that automatically strikes a foe, as 
magic missile. The force missile deals 1d4 points of damage plus the damage from your intense spells 
evocation power. This is a force effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 
your Intelligence modifier. 
Intense Spells (Su) Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, add ½ your wizard level 
to the damage. This bonus only applies once to a spell, not once per missile or ray, and cannot be split 
between multiple missiles or rays. This damage is of the same type as the spell. 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, 
and shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word “elven” in its name 
as a martial weapon.

Encumbrance light 10 lb., medium 20 lb., heavy 30 lb.; Weight Carried 0 lb. 
SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Alertness (Ex) While your familiar is within arm’s reach, you gain the Alertness feat. 
Deliver Touch Spells (Su) If you and your familiar are in contact at the time you cast a touch spell, you can 
designate your familiar as the toucher. Your familiar can then deliver the touch spell personally. As 
usual, if you cast another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. 
Empathic Link (Su) You have an empathic link with your familiar out to one mile. You cannot see through 
your familiar’s eyes, but you both can communicate empathically. Only general emotional content can 
be communicated. You have the same connection to an item or place that your familiar does. 
Improved Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, your familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if 
the saving throw fails. 
Share Spells Any spell you cast on yourself also affects your familiar if it is within 5 feet at the time of casting. 
If the spell is continuous, it stops affecting your familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away. Your 
familiar may accept such spells even if it would normally be an invalid target. 
Speak With Master (Ex) You and your familiar may communicate verbally, using a private language no one 
else understands.
