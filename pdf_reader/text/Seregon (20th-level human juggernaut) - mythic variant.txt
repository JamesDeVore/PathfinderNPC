Seregon 
“Stand before me and you’ll perish beneath me.” 
 
Considered a king among the barbarian tribes of 
the world, Seregon is said to be an invincible 
warrior. Originally hailing from a group called 
“the great eagle tribe,” Seregon now roams the 
world as an everyman, helping out wherever he 
can. His triumphs long ago made him a great hero 
among men. 
 
His legend began when his tribe was slaughtered 
by a horde of orcs. Not even an adult at the time, 
Seregon led a small band of survivors in a mission 
of revenge. They were killed to the man—leaving 
only Seregon. The stories say Seregon challenged 
the leader of the orcs for the right to rule the horde and beat him in one on one combat, but historians often 
disagree with each other on the matter. What is known as fact is that Seregon was not accepted as the horde’s 
new leader and was forced to flee for his life anyways. 
 
Many years later Seregon would unite and lead several impoverished barbarian tribes in a fierce war against the 
orc horde. Still without a leader and wholly chaotic, the orcs quickly fell to the furious onslaught and were 
forced out of the occupied valleys and back into their mountain homes. Seregon is the only known individual to 
have been offered the position “chief of chiefs” among all the barbarian tribes—and to have turned it down 
without hesitation or regret.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Absorb Blow (Su) As an immediate action, whenever you take hit point damage from a single source (such as a 
dragon’s breath, a spell, or a weapon), you can expend one use of mythic power to reduce the damage 
you take from that source by 5 per tier (to a minimum of 0 points of damage taken). If you have another 
ability or effect that reduces damage (such as protection from energy), reduce the damage with the 
absorb blow ability before applying any other damage-reducing effects. For every 10 points of damage 
that this ability prevents, for 1 minute you gain DR 1/epic and 5 points of resistance against acid, cold, 
electricity, fire, and sonic damage. The DR and resistances stack with any other DR and resistances that 
you have. 
Always a Chance (Ex) You don’t automatically miss when you roll a 1 on an attack roll.  
Amazing Initiative (Ex) You gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier (included above). In 
addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power to take an additional 
standard action during that turn. This additional standard action can’t be used to cast a spell. You can’t 
gain an extra action in this way more than once per round. 
Armor Mastery (Ex) You gain DR 5/– whenever you are wearing armor or using a shield. 
Armor Training (Ex) Whenever you are wearing armor, you reduce the armor check penalty by 4 (to a 
minimum of 0) and increase the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by your armor by 4. Additionally, 
you can move at your normal speed while wearing medium or heavy armor. 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +5 bonus on Will save against fear. 
Fleet Charge (Ex) As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to move up to your speed. At 
any point during this movement, you can make a single melee or ranged attack at your highest attack 
bonus, adding your tier to the attack roll. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round. 
Damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction. 
Fleet Warrior (Ex) When making a full attack, you can move up to your speed either before or after your 
attacks. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. 
Force of Will (Ex) You can exert your will to force events to unfold as you would like. As an immediate 
action, you can expend one use of mythic power to reroll a d20 roll you just made, or force any non-
mythic creature to reroll a d20 roll it just made. You can use this ability after the results are revealed. 
Whoever rerolls a roll must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. 
Hard to Kill (Ex) Whenever you’re below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing to attempt a 
Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose 
hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points 
when below 0 hit points. In addition, you don’t die until your total number of negative hit points is equal 
to or greater than double your Constitution score. 
Impossible Speed (Ex) Your base land speed increases by 30 feet (included above). In addition, if you expend 
one use of mythic power, for 1 hour your base land speed increases by 10 feet per mythic tier. 
Mythic Saving Throws (Ex) Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or special ability, you 
suffer no effects as long as that ability didn’t come from a mythic source (such as a creature with a 
mythic tier or mythic ranks). If you fail a saving throw that results from a mythic source, you take the 
full effects as normal. 
Precision (Ex) Whenever you make a full attack, your attack bonus on the additional attacks you gain by 
having a high base attack bonus is 5 higher for each time you take this ability. This ability can’t give any 
of these attacks a higher attack bonus than your base attack bonus and doesn’t reduce the penalties from 
two-weapon fighting or other situational penalties on attack rolls.  
Recuperation (Ex) You are restored to full hit points after 8 hours of rest so long as you aren’t dead. In 
addition, by expending one use of mythic power and resting for 1 hour, you regain a number of hit 
points equal to half your full hit points (up to a maximum of your full hit points) and regain the use of 
any class features that are limited to a certain number of uses per day (such as barbarian rage, bardic 
performance, spells per day, and so on). This rest is treated as 8 hours of sleep for such abilities. This 
rest doesn’t refresh uses of mythic power or any mythic abilities that are limited to a number of times 
per day. 

Sudden Block (Su) As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to hinder a melee attack 
made against you or an adjacent ally. Add your tier to your AC or the ally’s AC against this attack. The 
creature making the attack must make two attack rolls and take the lower result. Once the attack is 
resolved, you or your ally (your choice) can make one melee attack against the creature. The damage 
from this attack bypasses all damage reduction. 
Surge (Su) You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can expend one use of 
mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d10 and adding it to the result. Using 
this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change 
the outcome of the roll.  
Unstoppable (Ex) You can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to immediately end any one of the 
following conditions currently affecting you: bleed, blind, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, 
deafened, entangled, exhausted, fascinated, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, 
sickened, staggered, or stunned. All other conditions and effects remain, even those resulting from the 
same spell or effect that caused the selected condition. You can use this ability at the start of your turn 
even if a condition would prevent you from acting. 
Weapon Mastery (Ex) Any attacks you make with greatswords automatically confirm all critical threats and 
have their damage multiplier increased by 1 (×2 becomes ×3, for example). In addition, you cannot be 
disarmed while wielding a greatsword. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +6 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using heavy blades, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with heavy blades, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when 
defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against heavy blades. You gain similar bonuses with 
hammers, close weapons, and thrown weapons, but only at a +5, +4, and +3 bonus, respectively.
