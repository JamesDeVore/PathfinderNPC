SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bane (Su) You can imbue one of your weapons with the bane weapon special ability as a swift action. You 
must select one creature type when you use this ability (and a subtype if the creature type selected is 
humanoid or outsider). Once selected, the type can be changed as a swift action. This ability only 
functions while you wield the weapon. If dropped or taken, the weapon resumes granting this ability if it 
is returned to you before the duration expires. This ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to 
your inquisitor level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. 
Blast Rune (Sp) As a standard action, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent square. Any creature entering 
this square takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every two inquisitor levels you possess. This rune 
deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, decided when you create the rune. The rune is 
invisible and lasts a number of rounds equal to your inquisitor level or until discharged. You cannot 
create a blast rune in a square occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1
st-level spell for the 
purposes of dispelling. It can be discovered with a DC 26 Perception skill check and disarmed with a 
DC 26 Disable Device skill check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your 
Wisdom modifier. 
Cunning Initiative (Ex) You add your Wisdom modifier on initiative checks, in addition to your Dexterity 
modifier (included above). 
Discern Lies (Sp) You can discern lies, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to your inquisitor 
level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action. 
Heart of the Wilderness You gain a bonus equal to half your character level on Survival checks (included 
above). You also gain a +5 bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying and add half your 
character level to your Constitution score when determining the negative hit point total necessary to kill 
you. 
Heroic Each time you gain a new level you receive 3 hero points instead of 1. 
Judgment (Su) You can pronounce judgment upon your foes as a swift action. Starting when the judgment is 
made, you receive a bonus or special ability based on the type of judgment made. Once activated, this 
ability lasts until the combat ends, at which point all of the bonuses immediately end. You must 
participate in the combat to gain these bonuses. If you are frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, 
unconscious, or otherwise prevented from participating in the combat, the ability does not end, but the 
bonuses do not resume until you can participate in the combat again. When you use this ability, you 
must select two types of judgments to make. As a swift action, you can change this judgment to another 
type. All your judgment bonuses are sacred bonuses. The types of judgments are shown below. 
Monster Lore (Ex) You add your Wisdom modifier on Knowledge skill checks in addition to your Intelligence 
modifier, when making skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures. 
Second Judgment (Ex) Whenever you use your judgment ability, you select two different judgments, instead 
of one. This only consumes one use of your judgment ability. As a swift action, you can change one of 
these judgments to another type. 
Solo Tactics (Ex) All of your allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feats as you for the 
purpose of determining whether you receive a bonus from your teamwork feats. Your allies do not 
receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves. The allies’ 
positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for you to receive the 
listed bonus. 
Spell Rune (Sp) You can attach another spell that you cast to one of your blast runes, causing that spell to 
affect the creature that triggers the rune, in addition to the damage. This spell must be of at least one 
level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell you can cast and it must target one or more creatures. 
Regardless of the number of targets the spell can normally affect, it only affects the creature that triggers 
the rune. 
Stern Gaze (Ex) You receive a morale bonus on all Intimidate and Sense Motive checks equal to ½ your 
inquisitor level. 

Teamwork Feat As a standard action, you can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most 
recent bonus teamwork feat you have already learned. In effect, you lose the bonus feat in exchange for 
the new one. You can only change the most recent teamwork feat gained. Whenever you gain a new 
teamwork feat, the previous teamwork feat becomes set and cannot be changed again. You can change 
your most recent teamwork feat a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier. 
Track (Ex) You add half your inquisitor level on Survival skill checks made to follow or identify tracks.

(acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) chosen when the judgment is declared. The protection increases by 
2 for every three inquisitor levels you possess. 
Smiting This judgment bathes your weapons in a divine light. Your weapons count as magic for the purposes of 
bypassing damage reduction. At 6

good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The type selected must match one of 
your alignments. If you are neutral, you do not receive this bonus. At 10th level, your weapons also 
count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (but not for reducing hardness).
