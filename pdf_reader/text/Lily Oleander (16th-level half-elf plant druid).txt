SPECIAL ABILITIES 
A Thousand Faces (Su) You can change your appearance at will, as if using the alter self spell, but only while 
in your normal form. 
Bramble Armor (Su) You can cause a host of wooden thorns to burst from your skin as a free action. While 
bramble armor is in effect, any foe striking you with an unarmed strike or a melee weapon without reach 
takes 1d6 points of piercing damage + 1 point per two druid levels you possess. You can use this ability 
for a number of rounds per day equal to your druid level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. 
Nature Sense (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus to knowledge: nature checks and Survival checks (included above). 
Poisons You carry of variety of poisons, primarily for use with your poisoner’s glove: 
Black lotus extract—contact; save Fort DC 20, onset 1 minute, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 
1d3 Str, cure 2 consecutive saves. 
Oil of taggit—ingested; save Fort DC 15, onset 1 minute, effect unconsciousness for 1d3 hours, cure 1 
save. 
Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural 
abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as blight, 
entangle, spike growth, and warp wood. 
Timeless Body (Ex) You do not take ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any 
penalties you may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and you still 
die of old age when your time is up. 
Trackless Step (Ex) You leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. You may choose to leave 
a trail if so desired. 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check made to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your druid level and your 
Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a 
starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and 
the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an 
animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. 
Additionally, you may also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 
2, but you take a –4 penalty on the check. 
Wild Shape (Su) You have the ability to turn yourself into a variety of creatures and back again seven times per 
day. Your options for new forms include animals of Diminutive to Huge size, elementals of Small to 
Huge size, and plant creatures of Small to Huge size. This ability functions like the beast shape III spell 
(for animals), the elemental body IV spell (for elementals) or as the plant shape III spell (for plant 
creatures), except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until you change back. 
Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. 
The form chosen must be that of an animal, elemental, or plant creature with which you are familiar. 
You lose your ability to speak while in animal form because you are limited to the sounds that a normal, 
untrained animal can make, but you can communicate normally with other animals of the same general 
grouping as your new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this 
form does not permit speech.) 
Wooden Fist (Su) As a free action, your hands can become as hard as wood, covered in tiny thorns. While you 
have wooden fists, your unarmed strikes do not provoke attacks of opportunity, deal lethal damage, and 
gain a bonus on damage rolls equal to ½ your druid level (minimum +1). You can use this ability for a 
number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. These rounds do not need to be 
consecutive. 
Woodland Stride (Ex) You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, 
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any 
other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede 
motion, however, still affect you.
