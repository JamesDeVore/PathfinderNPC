SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Binding Darkness (Sp) As a standard action, you cast a weave of shadows at any foe within 30 feet as a ranged 
touch attack. The shadows entangle your foe for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every five wizard 
levels you possess. In conditions of bright light, this duration is halved (minimum 1 round). A creature 
entangled by your shadows has concealment from those without darkvision or the ability to see in 
darkness, and other creatures likewise have concealment relative to it. You can use this ability a number 
of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. 
Creepy Non-elf humanoids take a –1 penalty on saving throws against spells you cast that cause confusion or 
fear. In addition, you gain a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize. 
Dreamspeaker You add +1 to the saving throw DCs of divination spells and sleep effects that you cast. 
Additionally, you may use dream as a spell-like ability once per day with a caster level equal to your 
caster level, provided your Charisma score is 15 or higher. 
Extended Illusions (Su) Any illusion spell you cast with a duration of “concentration” lasts a number of 
additional rounds equal to ½ your wizard level after you stop maintaining concentration (minimum +1 
round). At 20th-level, you can make one illusion spell with a duration of “concentration” become 
permanent. You can have no more than one illusion made permanent in this way at one time. If you 
designate another illusion as permanent, the previous permanent illusion ends. 
Ongoing Spells You have cast the contingency spell upon yourself. Should you ever be made helpless against 
your will (such as when knocked unconscious, paralyzed, petrified, securely bound, or forcefully put to 
sleep), you are immediately subjected to magic jar, allowing you to possess nearby entities and continue 
the fight. Additionally, you have used the permanency spell to make the following spell effects 
permanent in regards to yourself: arcane sight, comprehend languages, greater darkvisionUM, see 
invisibility, and tongues. The following spells are also regularly active upon your person: greater false 
life
UM and mind blank. All ongoing spell effects function at 15th-caster level (and thus require a DC 26 
caster level check to dispel) and their effects are included in the above stats where appropriate. 
Shadow Spells (Su) You can use your shadow to prepare additional spells. You must spend your entire period 
of spell preparation in dim illumination to use this ability. You may prepare a number of additional spell 
levels of spells equal to the level of the highest-level wizard spell you can cast. For example, if you can 
cast 6th-level wizard spells, you could prepare six 1st-level spells, two 3rd-level spells, or any similar 
combination that adds up to a total of six spell levels. These spells are stored in your shadow. You can 
only cast these spells when you are in an area of normal light or dim light. These spells are marked with 
asterisks above. You also gain Shadowtongue as a bonus language. 
Shadow Step (Sp) You can use this ability to walk through the Shadow Plane and reappear as a standard action. 
You can travel up to 30 feet per wizard level per day in this fashion, either in a single round or broken 
up across multiple shadow steps. This movement must be used in 5-foot increments and does not 
provoke an attack of opportunity. Travel through the Shadow Plane is imprecise; when you arrive, you 
re-enter 1 square off target, as per the rules for thrown splash weapons. If this would place you in an 
occupied square, you instead arrive in the nearest safe location. When you arrive, you are cloaked in 
shadow and gain concealment as the blur spell for 1 round. You may bring other willing creatures with 
you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought with you. 
They likewise re-enter off target (roll location for each creature) and are cloaked in shadow for 1 round. 
Shadowsight (Ex) You gain darkvision 60 feet. 
Shadowy Specialization (Ex) When you cast shades, shadow conjuration, shadow evocation, and similar 
illusion spells that have a listed fraction of the strength of real effects, you increase the percentage of 

damage caused by the spell’s effect or summoned creatures by one-fifth (+20%) against creatures that 
make their saving throw against the effect, up to a maximum of 100% of the strength. For example, 
shadow evocation and shadow conjuration deal 40% normal damage on a successful save instead of 
20%.
