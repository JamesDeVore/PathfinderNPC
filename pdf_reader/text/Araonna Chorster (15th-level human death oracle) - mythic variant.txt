SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Amazing Initiative (Ex) You gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier (included above). In 
addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power to take an additional 
standard action during that turn. This additional standard action can’t be used to cast a spell. You can’t 
gain an extra action in this way more than once per round. 
Beyond Morality (Ex) You have no alignment. You can become a member of any class, even one with an 
alignment requirement, and can never lose your membership because of a change in alignment. If you 
violate the code of ethics of any of your classes, you might still lose access to certain features of such 
classes, subject to GM discretion. Attempts to detect your alignment don’t return any results. If a class 
restricts you from casting spells with an alignment descriptor, you can cast such spells without 
restrictions or repercussions. If you’re the target of a spell or effect that is based on alignment, you’re 
treated as the most favorable alignment when determining the spell’s effect on you. Any effects that 
alter alignment have no effect on you. If you lose this effect, you revert to your previous alignment. 
False Death (Su) Add charm person and dominate person to your spell list. You must select these spells using 
your allotment of spells known. Any creature under the effect of one of these spells or charm monster 
appears dead to any examiners. Although affected creatures do not detect as undead, they look pale and 
death-like while under the effects of your magic. Additionally, an affected creature ordered to lie still 
gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise skill checks to look like a corpse. 
Fearless (Su) You are immune to all fear effects from nonmythic sources. 
Force of Will (Ex) You can exert your will to force events to unfold as you would like. As an immediate 
action, you can expend one use of mythic power to reroll a d20 roll you just made, or force any non-
mythic creature to reroll a d20 roll it just made. You can use this ability after the results are revealed. 
Whoever rerolls a roll must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. 
Hard to Kill (Ex) Whenever you’re below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing to attempt a 
Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose 
hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points 
when below 0 hit points. In addition, you don’t die until your total number of negative hit points is equal 
to or greater than double your Constitution score. 
Inspired Spell (Su) You can expend one use of mythic power to cast any one divine spell, treating your caster 
level as 2 levels higher. This spell must be on your divine spell list (or your domain or mystery spell list) 
and must be of a spell level that you can cast using that divine spellcasting class. If you are a 
spontaneous spellcaster, you don’t need to have the spell prepared, nor does it need to be on your list of 
spells known. Using this ability does not expend a prepared spell or available spell slot. You can apply 
any metamagic feats you know to this spell, but its total spell slot level must be a slot level you can 
normally cast. 
Longevity (Su) You can no longer die from old age. If you have penalties to your physical ability scores due to 
aging, you no longer take those penalties. You still continue to age, and you gain all the benefits to your 
mental ability scores. 
Mythic Presence (Su) Your power unnerves ordinary mortals. By expending one use of mythic power, you 
gain an effect similar to frightful presence, except that creatures are affected according to their tier (or 
rank, in the case of monsters) instead of their Hit Dice. Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves are 
panicked for 1 minute, and those that succeed are shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with a mythic tier or 

rank equal to or less than your tier are unaffected if they succeed, and are shaken for 1 minute if they 
fail. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank higher than yours are unaffected by your mythic presence. The 
Will save against your mythic presence equals 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. This ability 
lasts for 1 minute and has a range of 30 feet. 
Mythic Saving Throws (Ex) Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or special ability, you 
suffer no effects as long as that ability didn’t come from a mythic source (such as a creature with a 
mythic tier or mythic ranks). If you fail a saving throw that results from a mythic source, you take the 
full effects as normal. 
Natural Divination (Ex) You can read the entrails of a freshly killed animal or humanoid to gain an insight 
bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on one saving throw. Alternatively, by observing and 
interpreting the flight of birds, you may apply a +10 competence bonus on any one skill check. Finally, 
by charting marks in dirt or on stone, or observing the behavior of sand thrown into the wind, you gain a 
+4 insight bonus on one initiative check. These bonuses must be used during the next 24 hours, and you 
must declare you are using the bonus before the check or save is made. Making a natural divination 
takes 10 minutes. You may use natural divination (in any combination) once per day plus one additional 
time per day for every four oracle levels you have attained. 
Necromantic Mastery (Su) When casting a necromancy spell, you can expend one use of mythic power as a 
free action to increase its caster level by your tier (minimum 2). 
No One of Consequence (Ex) Your mythic nature is a cloak that can shield you from the minds and memories 
of others. Creatures struggle to recognize you, recall your appearance, remember the nature of 
conversations they had with you, and recount the actions you took when you were in their presence. If a 
creature makes a deliberate attempt to recall details about time spent with you, it must succeed at a Will 
save (DC 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to recall anything beyond vague details. In addition, 
you’re under a permanent nondetection effect with a caster level equal to your character level plus your 
tier. You can end this effect at any time, and can resume it as a swift action. 
Ongoing Spells The following spells are regularly active upon your person: aura of doom, death ward (from 
darkskull), deathwatch, freedom of movement, protection from good (from darkskull), shield other (with 
cyclops), status (on cyclops, purple worm, and rocs), and tongues. Unless otherwise stated, all spells 
benefit from the Extend Spell feat. All ongoing spell effects function at 16th-caster level (and thus 
require a DC 26 caster level check to dispel) except for aura of doom and deathwatch, which function at 
17th-caster level (DC 27). These spell effects are included in the above and below stats where 
appropriate. 
Recuperation (Ex) You are restored to full hit points after 8 hours of rest so long as you aren’t dead. In 
addition, by expending one use of mythic power and resting for 1 hour, you regain a number of hit 
points equal to half your full hit points (up to a maximum of your full hit points) and regain the use of 
any class features that are limited to a certain number of uses per day (such as barbarian rage, bardic 
performance, spells per day, and so on). This rest is treated as 8 hours of sleep for such abilities. This 
rest doesn’t refresh uses of mythic power or any mythic abilities that are limited to a number of times 
per day. 
Reminder of Death (Su) You can imbue a handful of salt with the power of life, making it a potent ward 
against undead creatures. As a standard action, you can throw salt at a single undead creature within 5 
feet, affecting it as per the spell halt undead. Alternatively, you can spend a full-round action covering a 
5-foot-square with imbued salt, causing any single undead creature that enters this square within the next 
10 minutes to be affected as per halt undead. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 
3 + your Charisma modifier. The save DC is Charisma-based. 
Spirit Vessels (Su) You can channel wendo spirits into lifeless bodies, reanimating them to aid you. When 
using the animate dead spell, you can control 6 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level rather 
than 4 HD. In addition, any zombies or juju zombies you create using animate dead, create undead, or 
similar spells possess maximum hit points. 
Surge (Su) You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can expend one use of 
mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d8 and adding it to the result. Using this 

ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the 
outcome of the roll. 
Sustained by Faith (Su) You require no food, water, or sleep. If you have abilities or class features that require 
rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in 
uninterrupted meditation. You can expend one use of mythic power in order to also not need to breathe 
for 24 hours. 
Undead Servitude (Su) You gain Command Undead as a bonus feat. You can channel negative energy a 
number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier, but only to use Command Undead. You 
can take other feats to add to this ability, such as Improved Channel, but not feats that alter this ability, 
such as Alignment Channel.

hallow spell, or if its remains are sprinkled with a vial of holy water. 
 
Araonna’s giants serve as her shock troops and body guards. Wherever she goes, they go (though they are often

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Death Burst (Ex) When a plague zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of decay. All creatures adjacent to the 
plague zombie are exposed to its plague as if struck by a slam attack and must make a Fortitude save or 
contract zombie rot. 
Disease (Su) The slam attack—as well as any other natural attacks—of a plague zombie carries the zombie rot 
disease. Zombie rot: slam; save Fort DC = 10 + ½ the zombie’s Hit Dice + the zombie’s Cha modifier; 
onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is 
infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 
hours. 
Quick Strikes (Ex) Whenever a fast zombie takes a full-attack action, it can make one additional slam attack at 
its highest base attack bonus (included above). 
 
Araonna and her undead hoard often ride within her crimson worm while it burrows beneath the earth, allowing 
her to keep her undead hoard out of sight of those who might attempt to destroy them (or worse, wrest control 
from her). Once battle is joined, the worm emerges, releasing the hoard upon her enemies before submerging 
again and creating sink holes underneath large groups of enemies, burying them alive (to later be dug up and 
animated by Araonna). It is rumored that Araonna once destroyed an entire city by having her worm weaken its 
foundations for weeks, ultimately causing the entire city to collapse in on itself in one massive sink hole.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Flash of Insight (Su) Once per day as an immediate action, a cyclops can peer into an occluded visual spectrum 
of possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to select the exact result of one die roll before the roll is 
made. This effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops only, and cannot be applied to the rolls of 
others. 
 
In return for immortality, Cid now willingly serves as Araonna Chorster’s lieutenant (though she sometimes 
reinforces her dominance with Command Undead), commanding her undead minions in her absence. He also 
serves as her soothsayer, offering her wisdom when called upon. He is a cautious warrior and military tactician 
who prefers to think things through before resorting to violence. He has long been one of Araonna’s implacable 
allies and friends.

Araonna and Cid often use their rocs (formerly a mated pair) as steeds when aerial reconnaissance or assault is 
called for. Like her serpent, they are often kept in a temporary pocket plane until needed. 
 
Other Undead Minions: At any given moment, Araonna keeps no less than 150 undead soldiers (human fast 
plague zombies with 22 HP). These soldiers are uncontrolled and are often simply released into an area to create 
havoc among her enemies. For the safety of herself and others, she keeps these soldiers trapped within a pocket 
plane of her own design, allowing her to release them all anywhere in her vicinity simply by dispelling the 
plane.
