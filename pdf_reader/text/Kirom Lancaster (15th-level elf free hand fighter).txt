SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Acrobatic Charge (Ex) You may charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement. Depending on 
the circumstance, you may still need to make appropriate checks to successfully move over the terrain. 
Canny Defense (Ex) When wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, you add 1 point of Intelligence 
bonus (if any) per duelist class level as a dodge bonus to your Armor Class while wielding a melee 
weapon. If you are caught flat-footed or otherwise denied your Dexterity bonus, you also lose this 
bonus. 
Combat Reflexes You gain the benefit of the Combat Reflexes feat when using a light or one-handed piercing 
weapon (included above). 

 

 

Deflect Arrows You gain the benefit of the Deflect Arrows feat when using a light or one-handed piercing 
weapon (included above). You do not need a free hand to use this feat. 
Elaborate Defense (Ex) If you choose to fight defensively or use total defense in melee combat, you gain an 
additional +3 dodge bonus to AC. 
Enhanced Mobility (Ex) When wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, you gain an additional +4 
bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of a threatened square. 
Grace (Ex) You gain an additional +2 competence bonus on all Reflex saving throws (included above). This 
ability functions for you only when you are wearing light or no armor and not using a shield. 
Improved Reaction (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on initiative checks (included above). This bonus stacks with 
the benefit provided by the Improved Initiative feat. 
Long-Limbed You have a base move speed of 35 feet, rather than 30 feet. 
No Retreat (Ex) Enemies adjacent to you that take a withdraw action provoke an attack of opportunity from 
you. 
Parry (Ex) Whenever you take a full attack action with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, you can elect 
not to take one of your attacks. At any time before your next turn, you can attempt to parry an attack 
against you or an adjacent ally as an immediate action. To parry the attack, you make an attack roll, 
using the same bonuses as the attack you chose to forego during your previous action. If your attack roll 
is greater than the roll of the attacking creature, the attack automatically misses. For each size category 
that the attacking creature is larger than you, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll. You also take a   
–4 penalty when attempting to parry an attack made against an adjacent ally. You must declare the use 
of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made. 
Precise Strike (Ex) You gain the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, adding 
your duelist level to your damage roll. When making a precise strike, you cannot attack with a weapon 
in your other hand or use a shield. Your precise strike only works against living creatures with 
discernible anatomies. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is also immune to a precise strike, and 
any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from a precise strike. 
Reliable Strike (Ex) Once per day you may reroll an attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, miss chance 
check, or damage roll as an immediate action. You must accept the second roll even if it is worse. 
Riposte (Ex) You can make an attack of opportunity against any creature whose attack you successfully parry, 
so long as the creature you are attacking is within reach. 
Silent Hunter You reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving by 5 and can make Stealth checks while 
running at a –20 penalty (this number includes the penalty reduction from this racial trait). 
Weapon Guard (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus to CMD against disarm and sunder attempts while wielding your 
chosen weapon. This bonus also applies on saves against any effect that targets your chosen weapon (for 
example, grease, heat metal, shatter, warp wood). 
Weapon Training (Ex) You gain a +3 bonus on attack and damage rolls with your chosen weapon.
