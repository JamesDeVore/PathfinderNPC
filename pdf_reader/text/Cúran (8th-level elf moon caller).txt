SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Dreamspeaker You add +1 to the saving throw DCs of spells of the divination school and sleep effects that you 
cast. In addition, you may use dream once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level is equal to your 
character level). 
Moonlit Script (Su) Once per night while you sleep, your hands produce mysterious writing that pertains to the 
future. The prophetic writing manifest as an augury or divination spell with 90% effectiveness, or as a 
casting of commune with no material component required. 
Oracle’s Curse: Haunted Retrieving any stored item from your gear requires a standard action, unless it would 
normally take longer. Any item you drop lands 10 feet away from you in a random direction. Add ghost 
sound, levitate, mage hand and minor image to your list of spells known. 

Primal Companion (Ex) You gain the service of a faithful animal of the night. You can select from a bear, 
boar, crocodile, shark, tiger, or wolf. This animal functions as a druid’s animal companion, using your 
oracle level as your effective druid level (+1 level due to your favored class bonus). 
Prophetic Armor (Ex) You may use your Charisma modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) as part of 
your Armor Class and all Reflex saving throws. Your armor’s maximum Dexterity bonus applies to your 
Charisma, instead.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Beast Speech (Ex) A totem guide can speak with its master as though the two shared a common language, and 
it can speak with other animals of its species (or, at the GM’s discretion, other creatures with similar 
types). 
Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy 
checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a spell with a 
range of touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your animal companion even if the spells 
normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come 
from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities 
that are not spells, even if they function like spells. 
Spirit Animal: Bones Your animal companion gives off a ghostly glow and seems nearly transparent. The 
animal is often under the constant effect of blur, with a caster level equal to your oracle level. 
Spiritual Guidance (Sp) A totem guide can use guidance as a spell-like ability at will as a full-round action, 
targeting itself or its master. In addition, a totem guide’s master can spontaneously cast the following 
spells while adjacent to the totem guide by sacrificing a spell slot of equal or higher level: detect animals 
or plants (1st), augury (2
nd), helping hand (3
rd), divination (4th), commune with nature (5th), and find the 
path (6th). The totem guide serves as a divine focus for these spells, but costly material components must 

still be provided. 
Unnatural Aura (Su) Your animal companion is obviously of unnatural origin. Normal animals do not 
willingly approach your animal companion unless the animal’s master makes a DC 25 Handle Animal, 
Ride, or wild empathy check.
