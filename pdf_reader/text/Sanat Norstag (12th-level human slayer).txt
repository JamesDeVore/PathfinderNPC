SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Banner (Ex) As long as your banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +6 morale bonus on 
saving throws against fear and a +5 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. The banner 
must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by you or your mount to function. 
Braggart (Ex) You can spend a standard action to extol your own accomplishments and battle prowess. You 
receive Dazzling Display as a bonus feat. You do not need a weapon in hand to use this ability. You 
receive a +2 morale bonus on melee attack rolls made against demoralized targets. 
Cavalier’s Charge (Ex) You receive a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of 
the normal +2). In addition, you do not suffer any penalty to your AC after making a charge attack while 
mounted. 
Challenge (Ex) Four times per day, you can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, you choose one target 
within sight to challenge. Your melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against 
the target of your challenge. This extra damage is equal to your cavalier level. Challenging a foe 
requires much of your concentration causing you to take a –2 penalty to your Armor Class, except 
against attacks made by the target of your challenge. The challenge remains in effect until the target is 
dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. What’s more, you receive an additional +3 morale bonus 
to melee damage rolls against the target of your challenge, provided you are the only one threatening the 
target (not counting your mount). 
Demanding Challenge (Ex) As long as the target of your challenge is within your threatened area, it takes a –2 
penalty to its AC from attacks made by anyone other than you. 
Expert Trainer (Ex) You receive a bonus equal to ½ your cavalier level whenever you use Handle Animal on 
an animal that serves as a mount. In addition, you can reduce the time needed to teach a mount a new 
trick or train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week required by increasing the DC by +5. 
You can also train more than one mount at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the DC. 
Greater Tactician (Ex) You receive two teamwork feats as bonus feats. You must meet the prerequisites for 
these feats. Three times per day, as a swift action, you can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who 
can see and hear you. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two 
cavalier levels you possess. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. 
 Mighty Charge (Ex) Double the threat range of any weapons you wield during a charge while mounted. This 
increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, you 
can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if your charge attack is successful. 
This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity. 
Steal Glory (Ex) Whenever a creature other than you scores a critical hit against a target that you are 
threatening, you can make an attack of opportunity against the same target.
