SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Aura of Courage (Su) You are immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of you gains a 
+4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while you are 
conscious, not if you are unconscious or dead. 
Aura of Faith (Su) Your weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purposes of overcoming damage 
reduction. Any attack made against an enemy within 10 feet of you is treated as good-aligned for the 
purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This ability functions only while you are conscious, not if 
you are unconscious or dead. 
Aura of Justice (Su) You can expend two uses of your smite evil ability to grant the ability to smite evil to all 
allies within 10 feet, using your bonuses. Allies must use this smite evil ability by the start of your next 
turn and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. Evil creatures gain no benefit 
from this ability. 
Aura of Resolve (Su) You are immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of you 
gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects. This ability functions only while you 
are conscious, not if you are unconscious or dead. 
Channel Positive Energy (Su) By expending two uses of your lay on hands ability, you may release a burst of 
positive energy in a 30-ft. radius burst as a standard action. When doing so you can choose to harm 
undead creatures in the area (7d6 damage, Will DC 22 half) or to heal the living (7d6 healing, 7d6+14 to 
yourself). 
Craftsman You receive a +2 racial bonus on all Craft or Profession checks related to metal or stone. 
Defensive Training You gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by Giants. 
Detect Evil (Sp) At will, you can use detect evil, as the spell. You can as a move action, concentrate on a single 
item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, learning the strength of its aura as if having 
studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, you do not detect evil in any other 
object or individual within range. 
Divine Bond (Sp) Three times per day you may enhance a weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid 
of a celestial spirit for 1 minute per paladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed light 
as a torch. This spirit grants the weapon a +4 enhancement bonus. This bonus can be added to the 
weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of 
the following weapon properties: axiomatic, brilliant energy, defending, disruption, flaming, flaming 
burst, holy, keen, merciful, and speed. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to 
the property’s cost modifier. These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but 
duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be 
added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are 
determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The celestial 
spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than you but resumes giving bonuses if 
returned to you. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. If a weapon bonded with a 
celestial spirit is destroyed, you lose the use of this ability for 30 days, or until you gain a level, 
whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, you take a –1 penalty on attack and weapon damage 
rolls. 
Divine Grace (Su) You gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on all saving throws (included above). 
Divine Health (Ex) You are immune to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases such as 
mummy rot. 

Giant Hunter You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against humanoids with the giant subtype. Furthermore, you 
gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find and follow tracks made by humanoids with the giant subtype. 
Hardy You receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, spells, and spell-like abilities. 
Lay On Hands (Su) You can heal wounds (your own or those of others) by touch. Each day you can use this 
ability a number of times equal to ½ your paladin level plus your Charisma modifier. With one use of 
this ability, you can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels you possess, unless you 
target yourself, in which case you heal an additional +2 hit points of damage per die rolled. Using this 
ability is a standard action, unless you target yourself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the 
name of this ability, you only need one free hand to use this ability. Alternatively, you can use this 
healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two paladin 
levels you possess. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn’t 
provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage. 
Mercy (Su) Each mercy adds an effect to your lay on hands ability. Whenever you use lay on hands to heal 
damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by 
you. A mercy can remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison without curing the affliction. 
Such conditions return after 1 hour unless the mercy actually removes the affliction that causes the 
condition. These abilities are cumulative (that is, you cure all listed afflictions at once). 
Minesight The range of your darkvision is 90 feet, rather than 60 ft.; however, you are automatically dazzled in 
bright light and take a –2 penalty on saving throws against effects with the light descriptor. 
Smite Evil (Su) Five times per day you can call out to the powers of good to aid you in your struggle against 
evil. As a swift action, choose one target within sight to smite. If this target is evil, you add your 
Charisma bonus to your attack rolls and add your paladin level to all damage rolls made against the 
target of your smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an evil-aligned 
dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of 
damage per paladin level you possess. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks automatically bypass 
any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite evil is in effect, you gain a deflection bonus 
equal to your Charisma modifier (if any) to your AC against attacks made by the target of the smite. If 
you target a creature that is not evil, the smite is wasted with no effect. The smite evil effect remains 
until the target of the smite is dead or the next time you rest and regain your uses of this ability. 
Stability You receive a +4 racial bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip 
attempt while standing on the ground. 
Stonecunning You receive a +2 bonus on Perception checks to potentially notice unusual stonework, such as 
traps and hidden doors located in stone walls or floors. You receive a check to notice such features 
whenever you pass within 10 feet of them, whether or not you are actively looking. 
Vulnerability to Cold Iron (Su) You take 1 additional point of damage when attacked by cold iron weapons. 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with battleaxes, heavy picks, and warhammers, and treat any weapon 
with the word “dwarven” in its name as a martial weapon.
