SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Arcane Bolt (Sp) You can unleash a ray of magic force as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as 
a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you 
possess. This damage is treated as a spell of a level equal to half your sorcerer level, and is a force 
effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (plus 6 
additional uses due to favored class bonuses). 
Arcane Focus You gain a +2 racial bonus on Concentration checks made to cast arcane spells defensively. 
Concealed Gear You have used the magic aura spell to prevent all of your magical gear from radiating magic. 
Additionally, your implanted ioun stone has been painstakingly hidden, requiring a DC 29 Perception 
check to find when actively searched. 
Metamagic Adept (Ex) Four times per day you can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell you are 
about to cast without increasing the casting time. You must still expend a higher-level spell slot to cast 
this spell. 
New Arcana (Ex) You gain a small number of bonus spells. These spells are marked with a superscript “N” 
above. 
School Power (Ex) The DC for any spells you cast from the necromancy school increases by +2. This bonus 
stacks with the bonus granted by Spell Focus. 
Urbanite You gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks made to gather information and on Sense Motive 
checks made to get a hunch about a social situation.
