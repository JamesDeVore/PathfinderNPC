SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Amazing Initiative (Ex) You gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier (included above). In 
addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power to take an additional 
standard action during that turn. This additional standard action can’t be used to cast a spell. You can’t 
gain an extra action in this way more than once per round. 
Cat’s Luck (Ex) Once per day when you make a Reflex saving throw, you can roll the saving throw twice and 
take the better result. You must decide to use this ability before the saving throw is attempted. 
Climbing Master (Ex) You gain a climb speed equal to your base land speed and a +8 racial bonus on Climb 
checks. If you already have a climb speed, your base climb speed increases by 30 feet. In addition, you 
retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing. You can climb perfectly flat or smooth surfaces, 
treating them as if they had a Climb DC of 40. 
Extreme Endurance (Ex) You are inured to hot climate effects as if using endure elements. In addition, you 
gain 1 point of fire or cold resistance for every three barbarian levels beyond 3rd. 

Fast Sprinter (Ex) You gain a 10-foot racial bonus to your speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw 
actions. If you have the sprinter racial trait, your racial bonus to speed when using the charge, run, or 
withdraw action increases to a 20-foot bonus. 
Fleet Charge (Ex) As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to move up to your speed. At 
any point during this movement, you can make a single melee or ranged attack at your highest attack 
bonus, adding your tier to the attack roll. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round. 
Damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction. 
Fleet Warrior (Ex) When making a full attack, you can move up to your speed either before or after your 
attacks. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. 
Hard to Kill (Ex) Whenever you’re below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing to attempt a 
Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose 
hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points 
when below 0 hit points. In addition, you don’t die until your total number of negative hit points is equal 
to or greater than double your Constitution score. 
Impossible Speed (Ex) Your base land speed increases by 30 feet (included above). In addition, if you expend 
one use of mythic power, for 1 hour your base land speed increases by 10 feet per mythic tier. 
Lesser Beast Totem (Su) While raging, you gain two claw attacks. These attacks are considered primary 
attacks and are made at your full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 
if Small) plus your Strength modifier (but see Greater Beast Totem). 
Poison Blue whinnis—injury; save Fort DC 14, frequency 1/round for 2 rounds, effect 1 Con/unconsciousness 
1d3 hours, cure 1 save. 
Rage (Ex) You can enter a rage as a free action for 21 rounds each day. The total number of rounds of rage per 
day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in 
rage, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength, a +6 morale bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale 
bonus on Will saves. In addition, you take a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution 
grants you 3 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like 
temporary hit points. While in rage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based 
skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or 
concentration. You can end your rage as a free action and you become fatigued afterwards for a number 
of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot enter a new rage while 
fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. 
Your rage does not end, even if you fall unconscious, provided you still have rounds of rage remaining. 
Recuperation (Ex) You are restored to full hit points after 8 hours of rest so long as you aren’t dead. In 
addition, by expending one use of mythic power and resting for 1 hour, you regain a number of hit 
points equal to half your full hit points (up to a maximum of your full hit points) and regain the use of 
any class features that are limited to a certain number of uses per day (such as barbarian rage, bardic 
performance, spells per day, and so on). This rest is treated as 8 hours of sleep for such abilities. This 
rest doesn’t refresh uses of mythic power or any mythic abilities that are limited to a number of times 
per day. 
Sprint (Ex) Once per rage, you can use a single full-round run action to move up to 6 times your speed or a 
single full-round charge action to move up to 3 times your speed. 
Sprinter You gain a 10-foot racial bonus to your speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions (but 
see Fast Sprinter). 
Surge (Su) You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can expend one use of 
mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d10 and adding it to the result. Using 
this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change 
the outcome of the roll.  
Swift Foot (Ex) You gain a 10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed while raging. 
Swimming Master (Ex) You gain a swim speed equal to your base land speed and a +8 racial bonus on Swim 
checks. If you already have a swim speed, your base swim speed increases by 30 feet. You can hold 
your breath for a number of minutes equal to 10 × your Constitution score, but afterward you must 

succeed at checks as normal to avoid drowning. If you expend one use of mythic power, for 1 hour your 
base swim speed increases by 10 feet per mythic tier.
