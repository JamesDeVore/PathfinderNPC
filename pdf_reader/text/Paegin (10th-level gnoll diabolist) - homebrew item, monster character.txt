SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Corrupting Touch (Sp) You can cause a creature to become shaken as a melee touch attack. This effect 
persists for a number of rounds equal to ½ your sorcerer level. Creatures shaken by this ability radiate an 
aura of evil, as if they were an evil outsider (see detect evil). Multiple touches do not stack, but they do 
add to the duration. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma 
modifier. 
Hellfire (Sp) Once per day you can call down a column of hellfire. This 10-foot-radius burst does 1d6 points of 
fire damage per sorcerer level. Those caught in the area of your blast receive a Reflex save for half 
damage. Good creatures that fail their saves are shaken for a number of rounds equal to your sorcerer 
level. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + ½ your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. This power 
has a range of 60 feet. 

 
ROBE OF SHADOWS 
Aura strong evocation; CL 20th 
Slot robe; Price 40,000gp; Weight 1 lb. 
 
This menacing black robe, created from the hide of a shadow demon, drains away light and sound from its 
immediate surroundings, granting a +20 competence bonus on Stealth checks to its wearer. Like a black robe of 
the archmagi, a robe of shadows is attuned to the evil alignment. If it is ever donned by a good character, she 
immediately gains three permanent negative levels. A neutral character who wears the robe gains two 
permanent negative levels. While these negative levels remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be 
overcome in any way (including restoration spells). These penalties are immediately removed if the robe is 
removed. 
 
Construction Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, darkness; Cost 20,000gp
