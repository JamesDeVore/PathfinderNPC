SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Armor Training (Ex) When wearing armor, you reduce your armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) 
and increase your armor’s maximum Dexterity modifier limit by 1. In addition, your speed is not 
reduced for wearing medium armor. 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects (included above). 
Flurry of Stars (Ex) You can expend 1 ki point from your ki pool as a swift action before you make a 
full-attack attack with shuriken. During that attack, you can throw two additional shuriken at your 
highest attack bonus, but all your shuriken attacks are made at a –2 penalty, including the two extra 
attacks. 
Ki Pool (Su) You have a pool of ki points, supernatural energy you can use to accomplish amazing feats. The 
number of points in your ki pool is equal to ½ your ninja level + your Charisma modifier. As long as 
you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, you treat any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if you had 
a running start. By spending 1 point from your ki pool, you can make one additional attack at your 
highest attack bonus, but you can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, you can spend 1 

point to increase your speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to 
give yourself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth skill checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as 
a swift action. You can gain additional powers that consume points from your ki pool by selecting 
certain ninja tricks. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these 
hours do not need to be consecutive. 
Poison Use You are trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison yourself when applying poison 
to a weapon. 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals 1d6 extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to 
AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flank your target. This bonus 
damage is considered precision damage. Should you score a critical hit with precision damage is not 
multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon 
that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), you can make a sneak attack that 
deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to 
deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be able to see the 
target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak 
attack while striking a creature with concealment. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using thrown weapons, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with thrown weapons, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when 
defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against thrown weapons.
