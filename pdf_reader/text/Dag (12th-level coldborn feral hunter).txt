SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Animal Focus (Su) You can take on the aspect of an animal as a swift action. You must select one type of 
animal to emulate, gaining a bonus or special ability based on the type of animal emulated and your 
hunter level. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your hunter level. This 
duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. You can emulate 
only one animal at a time. You can also apply one of these aspects to your animal companion. Unlike 
with yourself, there is no duration on the animal aspect applied to your animal companion. An aspect 

applied in this way does not count against your minutes of duration per day—it remains in effect until 
you change it. The companion’s aspect can be the same aspect you have taken on or a different one. You 
can select or change the animal foci on both yourself and your animal companion as part of the same 
swift action. If your animal companion is dead, you can apply your companion’s animal focus to 
yourself instead of your animal companion. This is in addition to the normal one you can choose, and (as 
with a companion’s focus) remains in effect until you change it instead of counting against your minutes 
per day. A list of animal aspects are shown below. 
Change Shape You can change shape into a bestial form as a standard action. In bestial form, you gain a +2 
racial bonus to Wisdom. While in this form, you also take on an animalistic feature that provides a 
special effect. Each time you assume bestial form, you can choose to gain two of the following features: 
bite attack (1d6), 2 claws (1d4), climb 20 ft., or scent (30 ft.). The racial ability score bonus and 
additional features last as long as you remain in that form, and you can remain in bestial form for as long 
as you want. While in bestial form, you take a –4 penalty on Charisma and Charisma-based checks when 
interacting with humanoids that lack the shapechanger subtype. You can return to your humanoid form 
as a swift action. To change forms and gain a different benefit, you must first return to your humanoid 
form then use your shapechange ability again. You can shapechange into bestial form a number of times 
per day equal to 3 + ½ your character level. 
Hunter Tactics (Ex) You automatically grant your teamwork feats to your animal companion. The companion 
doesn’t need to meet the prerequisites of these teamwork feats. 
Improved Empathic Link (Su) You gain an empathic link with your animal companion out to one mile. You 
can communicate empathically with your animal companion and can also see through a companion’s 
eyes as a swift action, maintaining this connection as long as you like (as long as the companion is 
within 1 mile) and ending it as a free action. You are blinded while maintaining this connection. 
Because of the link’s limited nature, only general emotions can be shared. You have the same 
connection to an item or place that your animal companion does. 
Nature Training (Ex) You count your total hunter level as both druid levels and ranger levels for the purpose 
of qualifying for feats, traits, and options that modify or improve an animal companion. 
Raise Animal Companion (Sp) You gain raise animal companion as a spell-like ability; this is not restricted to 
raising only your own animal companion. Using this spell-like ability gives you a permanent negative 
level. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration), but automatically 
ends after 24 hours. 
Second Animal Focus (Su) Whenever you use your animal focus ability, you select two different animal 
aspects for yourself instead of one, and can assign two aspects to your animal companion instead of one. 
As with the companion’s previous aspect, the second one does not count against the minutes per day you 
can take on an aspect. If your animal companion is dead and you have applied the companion’s animal 
aspect to yourself, that aspect does not count toward your maximum of two aspects at once. You can still 
apply only one of your dead companion’s aspects to yourself, not both. 
Speak with Master (Ex) You and your animal companion can communicate verbally, as if you were using a 
common language. Other creatures cannot understand the communication without magical aid. 
Swift Tracker (Ex) You can move at your normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking 
the normal −5 penalty. You take only a −10 penalty (instead of the normal −20) when moving at up to 
twice normal speed while tracking. 
Teamwork Feat As a standard action, you can choose to learn a new bonus teamwork feat in place of the most 
recent bonus teamwork feat you have already learned. In effect, you lose the bonus feat in exchange for 
the new one. You can change only the most recent teamwork feat gained, and must meet the 
prerequisites for the newly selected feat. You can change your most recent teamwork feat a number of 
times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). Whenever you gain a new teamwork feat, 
your previous teamwork feats become permanent. 
Track (Ex) You add ½ your hunter level to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks. 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions as a Diplomacy 
check to improve the attitude of a person, but you roll 1d20 and add your hunter level and your 
Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a 

starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and 
the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an 
animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. You 
can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you take a 
−4 penalty on the check. 
Woodland Stride (Ex) You and your animal companion may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as 
natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking 
damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or 
magically manipulated to impede motion will still affect you and your animal companion.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Devotion (Ex) An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and 
effects. 
Evasion (Ex) If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half 
damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw. 
Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy 
checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a spell with a 
range of touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your animal companion even if the spells 
normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come 

from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities 
that are not spells, even if they function like spells.
