SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bonded Object (Sp) If you attempt to cast a spell without your bonded object worn or in hand, you must make 
a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. A 
bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that you have in your spellbook and are 
capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by you, 
including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on your caster level. This spell cannot be 
modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from 
your opposition schools. The magic properties of your bonded object, including any magic abilities 
added to the object, only function for you. 
Diviner’s Fortune (Sp) Twelve times per day you can touch any creature as a standard action to give it a +7 
insight bonus on all of its attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round. 
Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage 
on a successful save, you instead take no damage. If you are helpless or are not wearing your ring of 
evasion, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Forewarned (Su) You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a Perception roll to notice a 
foe, but you are still considered flat-footed until you take an action. In addition, you receive a bonus on 
initiative checks equal to ½ your wizard level (included above). 
Gem Mage You are a rare and gifted arcanist skilled at attuning precious gemstones with your magic. You gain 
the Attune Gems feat as a bonus feat (which functions identically to and replaces the Scribe Scroll feat). 
Instead of placing your spells on paper, you imbed them in valuable gemstones for later use. Attuned 
gems work in every way like arcane spell scrolls (the cost of the gem is subsumed in the cost to make it 
attuned). 
Scrying Adept (Su) You are always aware when you are being observed via magic, as if you had a permanent 
detect scrying. In addition, whenever you scry on a subject, treat the subject as one step more familiar to 
you. Very familiar subjects get a –10 penalty on their save to avoid your scrying attempts.
