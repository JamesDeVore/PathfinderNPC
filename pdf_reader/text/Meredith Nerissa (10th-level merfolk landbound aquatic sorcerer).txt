SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Aquatic Adaptation (Ex) You gain a swim speed of 30 feet, the amphibious special quality, and develop a fat 
layer that grants a +1 natural armor bonus and resist cold 5. When immersed in water, you gain 
blindsense 30 feet. 
Aquatic Telepathy (Su) You gain telepathy (100 feet) and can communicate with creatures with a swim speed 
or the aquatic or water types regardless of intelligence. You may cast suggestion on such creatures a 
number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier. This ability is telepathic and does not require 
audible or visual components. 

Bloodline Arcana When you are in a body of water large enough to float in, your effective caster level is 
increased by 1. 
Water Blast (Sp) As a standard action, you can fire a bolt of water at a foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch 
attack. The foe is knocked prone, and at your option may be pushed 5 feet directly away from you. A 
reflex save (DC 10 + ½ your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect. You can use 
this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. 
 
Celon 
Created by Meredith to serve primarily as a transportation device in the lands of walkers, Celon is an intelligent 
glass chariot, made of nearly invisible glass shaped into a large sphere with an open top. Despite its fragile 
appearance, it is as hard and durable as thick iron. It functions in every way as a cauldron of flying. Celon exists 
only to serve, and lacks any special purpose or other motivation common to other intelligent magical items. 
Like other merfolk, Meredith does not like to be out of water for long, and so keeps it filled with clean water at 
all times. When not controlled by another, it can fly itself around independently, allowing it to be called into 
service from a distance. Not particularly loyal to anyone, Celon will come to the call of anyone who happens to 
be nearby (if not already controlled). In the event of conflicting orders, however, it always gives priority to 
creatures of the sea (such as merfolk) first, and to those with higher Charisma second. 
 
The flying cauldron, Celon, possesses the following stats: AL N; Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 10; Empathy; Darkvision 
120 ft.; Can cast create water at will; Ego score 5.
