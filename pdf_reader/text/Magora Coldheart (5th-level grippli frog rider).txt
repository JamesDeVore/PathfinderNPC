SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Aid Allies (Ex) Whenever you use the aid another action to assist one of your allies, the ally receives a +3 
bonus to his Armor Class, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. At 8th-level, and every six levels 
thereafter, this bonus increases by an additional +1. 
Banner (Ex) Your banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to your allies and companions. As long as your 
banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear 
and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. The banner must be at least Small or 
larger and must be carried or displayed by you or your mount to function. 
Cavalier’s Charge (Ex) You learn to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. You receive a +4 
bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, you do 
not suffer any penalty to your AC after making a charge attack while mounted. 
Challenge (Ex) Twice per day, you can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, you choose one target 
within sight to challenge. Your melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against 
the target of your challenge. This extra damage is equal to your cavalier level. Challenging a foe 
requires much of your concentration. You take a –2 penalty to your Armor Class, except against attacks 
made by the target of your challenge. The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or 
unconscious or until the combat ends. In addition, whenever you issue a challenge, your allies receive a 

+1 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls against the target of your challenge whenever you are 
threatening the target. This bonus increases by +1 for every four cavalier levels you possess. 
Swamp Stride (Ex) You can move through difficult terrain at your normal speed while within a swamp. 
Magically altered terrain affects you normally. 
Tactician (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, you can grant one of your teamwork class bonus feats to all 
allies within 30 feet who can see and hear you. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 
round for every two cavalier levels you possess. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these 
bonus feats.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy 
checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion. 
Pull (Ex) A giant frog can choose to make a free combat maneuver check with a successful tongue attack. If 
successful, this check pulls a creature 5 feet closer. This ability only works on creatures of a size equal 
to or smaller than the giant frog. Creatures pulled in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity and 
stop if the pull would move them into a solid object or creature. 
Swallow Whole (Ex) If a giant frog begins its turn with an opponent grappled in its mouth, it can attempt a new 
combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, 
and the opponent takes bite damage. The opponent must be up to one size category smaller than the 
giant frog. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round, as shown above. A swallowed 
creature keeps the grappled condition, while the giant frog does not. A swallowed creature can try to cut 
its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (the amount of cutting damage required to get 
free is equal to 
1/10 the giant frog’s total hit points), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The Armor 
Class of the interior of a giant frog is normally 10 + ½ its natural armor bonus, with no modifiers for 
size or Dexterity. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the giant frog cannot use swallow whole 

again until the damage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in 
the giant frog’s mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again. 
Tongue (Ex) A giant frog’s tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times the frog’s normal reach 
(15 feet for a Medium giant frog). A giant frog’s tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to 
grab. A giant frog does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.
