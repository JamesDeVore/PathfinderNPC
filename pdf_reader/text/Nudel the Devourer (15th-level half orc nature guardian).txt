SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Fast Movement (Ex) Your land speed is faster than the norm for your race by +10 feet. This benefit applies 
only when you are wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. 
Apply this bonus before modifying your speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus 
stacks with any other bonuses to your land speed. 

Greater Guarded Life (Ex) While raging, if you are reduced below 0 hit points, 2 hit points of lethal damage 
per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. If you are at negative hit points due to lethal 
damage, you immediately stabilize. 
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. You still 
lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized or when an opponent successfully uses the feint action 
against you. You also cannot be flanked. This denies a rogue their sneak attack, unless they are 8th-level 
or higher. 
Migrating Herd (Su) When you summon an aurochs, bison, elephant, horse, mastodon, pony, or similar 
quadruped herbivore with a summoning spell, the duration of the spell is increased by 100% (this does 
not stack with Extend Spell). The creature’s land speed is increased by 10 feet. 
Moment of Clarity (Ex) You may choose to not gain any benefits or take any of the penalties from rage for 1 
round. Activating this power is a swift action. This includes the penalty to Armor Class and the 
restriction on what actions can be performed. This round still counts against your total number of rounds 
of rage per day. This power can only be used once per rage. 
Nature Sense (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus to knowledge: nature checks and Survival checks (included above). 
Pounce (Ex) You may use the pounce special attack once per day. 
Rage (Ex) You can rage for 22 rounds per day. Entering a rage is a free action. The total number of rounds of 
rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. 
While in rage, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale 
bonus on Will saves. In addition, you take a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution 
grants you 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like 
temporary hit points. While in rage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based 
skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or 
concentration. You can end your rage as a free action and are fatigued after rage for a number of rounds 
equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or 
exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall 
unconscious, your rage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death. 
Resist Nature’s Lure (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural 
abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as blight, 
entangle, spike growth, and warp wood. 
Sacred Tattoo You gain a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws (included above). 
Shaman’s Apprentice You gain Endurance as a bonus feat. 
Skilled You gain 1 extra skill rank per level like a human. 
Trackless Step (Ex) You leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. You may choose to leave 
a trail if so desired. 
Trap Sense (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +4 dodge bonus to AC against 
attacks made by traps. 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with greataxes and falchions and treat any weapon with the word “orc” 
in its name as a martial weapon. 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check made to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your druid level and your 
Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a 
starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and 
the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an 
animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. 
Additionally, you may also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 
2, but you take a –4 penalty on the check. 
Wild Shape (Su) You have the ability to turn yourself into a variety of creatures and back again four times per 
day. Your options for new forms include animals of Diminutive to Huge size, Medium elementals, and 
Small or Medium plant creatures. This ability functions like the beast shape III spell (for animals), the 
elemental body II spell (for elementals) or as the plant shape I spell (for plant creatures), except as noted 
here. The effect lasts for 8 hours, or until you change back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a 

standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an 
animal, elemental, or plant creature with which you are familiar. You can communicate normally with 
other animals of the same general grouping as your new form. While wild shaped, you gain an 
additional +2 bonus to your natural armor bonus thanks to your favored class bonuses from druid. 
Woodland Stride (Ex) You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, 
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any 
other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede 
motion, however, still affect you.
