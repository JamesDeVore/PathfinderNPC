SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Combined Spells (Su) You can prepare and cast spells from one of your spellcasting classes using the available 
slots from any of your other spellcasting classes. Spells prepared or cast in this way take up a slot one 
level higher than they originally occupied. This ability cannot be used to cast a spell at a lower level if 
that spell exists on both spell lists. You may only cross 5th-level or lower spells in this fashion. The 
components of these spells do not change, but they otherwise follow the rules for the spellcasting class 
used to cast the spell. 
Contingencies/Ongoing Spells You have cast the contingency spell upon yourself. Should you ever die, you 
immediately come under the effect of a breath of life spell. Additionally, you have used the permanency 
spell to make the following spell effects permanent in regards to yourself: arcane sight, comprehend 
languages, see invisibility, and tongues. The following spells are also regularly active upon your person: 
endure elements and overland flight. Additionally, you have a treant servant (via the liveoak spell) and 
rule over a small demiplane (via the create demiplane spell), a natural sanctuary that possesses earth-like 
cycles and is filled with bountiful plant and animal life. All ongoing spell effects function at 17th-caster 
level (and thus require a DC 28 caster level check to dispel) and their effects are included in the above 
stats where appropriate. 
Devotee of the Green You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (geography) and Knowledge (nature) checks, 
and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you. 
Esoteric Training Due to your membership in a spellcasting guild (and Fame score of 35+) you gain a +3 
bonus to your caster level with wizard spells and a +1 bonus to your caster level with druid spells (up to 
a maximum of your character level). These bonuses grant you additional spells known and spells per day 
for your modified caster level. 
Magical Knack You gain a +2 trait bonus to your caster level with wizard spells, provided it does not increase 
your caster level higher than your character level. 
Nature Sense (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus to knowledge: nature checks and Survival checks (included above). 
Senior Guild Member Using guild contacts, you can earn an additional 10% profit when selling magical 
wondrous items. 
Spell Synthesis (Su) Once per day you can cast two spells, one from each of your spellcasting classes, using 
one action. Both of the spells must have the same casting time. You can make any decisions concerning 
the spells independently. Any target affected by both of the spells takes a –2 penalty on saves made 
against each spell. You receive a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance 
with these two spells. 
Summoner’s Charm (Su) You increase the duration of all of your summoning spells by 1 round. 
Trackless Step (Ex) You leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. You may choose to leave 
a trail if so desired. 

Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy 
check made to improve the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your druid level and your 
Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a 
starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and 
the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an 
animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. You 
can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but you take a –
4 penalty on the check. 
Woodland Stride (Ex) You may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, 
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any 
other impairment. Thanks to your ring of sacred mistletoe, not even thorns, briars, and overgrown areas 
that have been magically manipulated to impede your movement.

Encumbrance light 10 lb., medium 20 lb., heavy 30 lb.; Weight Carried 0 lb. 
SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Deliver Touch Spells (Su) A familiar can deliver touch spells for you. If you and the familiar are in contact at 
the time you cast a touch spell, you can designate your familiar as the “toucher.” The familiar can then 
deliver the touch spell just as you would. As usual, if you cast another spell before the touch is 
delivered, the touch spell dissipates. 
Empathic Link (Su) You have an empathic link with your familiar to a 1 mile distance. You can communicate 
emphatically with your familiar, but cannot see through its eyes. Because of the link’s limited nature, 
only general emotions can be shared. You have the same connection to an item or place that your 
familiar does. 
Improved Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the 
saving throw fails. 
Share Spells You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your familiar (as a touch spell) instead of on 
yourself. You may cast spells on your familiar even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of the 
familiar’s type (magical beast).

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Evasion (Ex) If your animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half 
damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw. 
Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy 
checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding your animal companion. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a spell with a 
range of touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your animal companion even if the spells 
normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come 
from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities 
that are not spells, even if they function like spells.
