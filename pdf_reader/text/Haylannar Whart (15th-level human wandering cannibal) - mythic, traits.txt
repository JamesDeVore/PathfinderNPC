Haylannar Whart 
“There is nothing unnatural about a predator devouring his prey.” 
 
Haylannar Whart has been  gifted with arcane talent since he  was  a 
young boy.  He was particularly  fond of transmutation spells  for the 
chaotic magic  inherit to  their  nature.  While still  young  he was 
discovered by a powerful master specialist, a transmuter and archmage 
who was intrigued at the boy’s uncanny knack  for the arcane  arts. 
Haylannar trained under his mistress’  cruel tutelage for many hard 
years before her frail form finally succumbed to old age  and death, 
leaving him alone and financially desititute. 
 
Due to the abrupt end of his apprenticeship, Haylannar was forced out 
onto the streets to  fend for  himself.  Soon after, a  gang of bandits 
ambushed the wayward Haylannar on the road. After Haylannar nearly 
succumbed to the bandit leader’s attacks, a traveling merchant and his 
guards chanced upon the scene. Before anyone could come to his 
rescue, however, Haylannar spontaneously transformed himself into a 
horrific monster and tore his would be attackers apart in a gory display 
of carnage and canibalism.  The  merchant  was  wildly amused at the 
gruesome  spectacle  and  offered to  take  the  young Haylannar in and 
give him a life of oppulance in return for acting as a member of his elite caravan guard. 
 
Life was good for a time, but Haylannar’s new master soon passed on as well, his heart having given out after 
years of over-indulgements. With no heir apparent to take over the man’s trade empire, Haylannar Whart took the 
opportunity to sieze the assets for himself. For decades he wondered the world free from all masters, trading rare, 
powerful magical items to wealthy clientel. It was the exposure to one such item, a powerful and chaotic artifact, 
that would permanently alter Haylannar’s destiny forever. Not knowing the true power of what he possessed, 
Haylannar acted as he always did when he was once again beset by those who would steal his wares. During the 
battle, the artifact briefly became part of Haylannar’s body when he transformed—and in so doing forever left a 
fragment of its power within him. 
 
After the transformation into a mythic being, his behavior became more erratic, causing his business to fall apart 
and leaving him with nothing, but the personal possessions he could carry. He has long since developed a nasty 
reputation as a half mad wizard and violent cannibal—as well as one of the most powerful transmuters to have 
ever lived. There are some who even say he is, and always was, actually a demon in disguise. He now wonders 
the world as an adventurer looking for powerful magic to possess, and for ever greater foes to devour.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Amazing Initiative (Ex) You gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier (included above). In 
addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power to take an additional 
standard action during that turn. This additional standard action can’t be used to cast a spell. You can’t 
gain an extra action in this way more than once per round. 
Battleshaping (Su) As a swift action, you grow two natural weapons. These natural weapons last for 1 round 
and have a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls for every four wizard levels you possess. 
You can grow a claw, a bite, or a gore attack. These attacks deal the normal damage for a creature of 
your size. You may not grow additional limbs or a tail with this ability. You can use this ability a 
number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. 
Bonded Object (Sp) If you attempt to cast a spell without your bonded object worn or in hand, you must make 
a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. A 
bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that you have in your spellbook and are 
capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by you, 
including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on your caster level. This spell cannot be 
modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from 
your opposition schools. The magic properties of your bonded object, including any magic abilities 
added to the object, only function for you. 
Change Shape (Sp) You can change your shape for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. 
These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This ability otherwise functions like beast shape III or 
elemental body II. 
Hard to Kill (Ex) Whenever you’re below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing to attempt a 
Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose 
hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points 
when below 0 hit points. In addition, you don’t die until your total number of negative hit points is equal 
to or greater than double your Constitution score. 
Mage Strike (Su) As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one melee attack. This is 
in addition to any other attacks you make this round. If you expend one arcane spell that you’ve 
prepared or arcane spell slot that you have available, you gain a bonus on the attack roll equal to double 
the spell’s or slot’s level, and the attack deals an additional 2d6 points of energy damage (your choice of 
acid, cold, electricity, or fire) per level of the spell or slot expended. The normal damage from this attack 
bypasses all damage reduction, but the energy damage is still affected by resistances and immunities. 
Magical Lineage When you apply metamagic feats to the above spell, treat its actual level as 1 lower for 
determining the spell’s final adjusted level. 
Ongoing Spells You have cast extended contingency upon yourself. Should you ever be made helpless against 
your will (such as when knocked unconscious, paralyzed, petrified, securely bound, or forcefully put to 
sleep), you are immediately teleported (as per the teleport spell) to the nearest known temple dedicated 
to your deity. Your person carries upon it a note with detailed instructions for the temple’s priests should 
you not be in a position to direct them to your aid personally. Additionally, you have used the 
permanency spell to give yourself the benefits of arcane sight and see invisibility. The following spells 
are also regularly active upon your person: age resistance
UM, darkvision, overland flight and ride the 
wavesUM. Your club has been subject to greater magic weapon. All ongoing spell effects function at 

16th-caster level (and thus require a DC 27 caster level check to dispel), with the exception of 
transmutation spells whose effects function at 17
th-caster level (DC 28) and polymorph spells whose 
effects function at 18th-caster level (DC 29). Their respective effects are included in the above stats 
where appropriate. 
Physical Enhancement (Su) You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, 
Dexterity, or Constitution). This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess to a 
maximum of +5 at 20
th level. You can change this bonus to a new ability score when you prepare spells. 
Unless otherwise stated, assume it applies to Constitution. 
Shapeshifting Mastery (Ex) You add half your tier to the caster level of spells or extracts from the polymorph 
subschool. While under the effects of a spell or extract of the polymorph subschool, you can use your 
caster level instead of your base attack bonus when making natural attacks that rely on your new form. 
Surge (Su) You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can expend one use of 
mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. Using this 
ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the 
outcome of the roll.

Breath Weapon (Su) A gorgon can use its breath weapon once every 1d4+1 rounds to create a 60-foot cone of 
green gas. Those caught in the area of the gas can attempt a DC 28 Fortitude save to resist the effects, 
but those who fail the save are immediately petrified. This petrification is temporary—each round, a 
petrified creature can attempt a new DC 28 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification as long as it 
is not caught within the area of effect of the gorgon’s breath weapon a second time while petrified. A 
creature exposed to the gorgon’s breath a second time while already petrified becomes permanently 
petrified, and can no longer attempt to make additional Fortitude saves to recover naturally.

normal noise does not. This is a sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.
