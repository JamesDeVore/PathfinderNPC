SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Armor Specialization (Ex) While wearing full plate, you add 3 to the armor bonus. This increase to the armor 
bonus doesn’t increase the benefit that you gain from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are 
determined by your armor’s base armor bonus, including other advanced armor training options. 
Armored Juggernaut (Ex) You gain DR 1/– when wearing light armor, DR 2/– when wearing medium armor, 
and DR 3/– when wearing heavy armor. The DR from this ability stacks with that provided by 
adamantine armor, but not with other forms of damage reduction. This damage reduction does not apply 
if you are helpless, stunned, or unconscious. 
Armor Training (Ex) When wearing armor, you reduce your armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) 
and increase your armor’s maximum Dexterity modifier limit by 1. In addition, your speed is not 
reduced for wearing medium or heavy armor. 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. Additionally, this bonus 
applies to your allies, provided they are within 30 feet of you, can see and hear you, and you are not 
unconscious, stunned, dazed, or confused. 
Master Armorer (Ex) You can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in the Craft (armor) skill. 
You substitute your total base attack bonus (including your base attack bonus gained through levels in 
other classes) for your ranks in this skill, but add the skill’s usual ability score modifier and any other 
bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Additionally, you are treated as having the Craft 
Magic Arms and Armor and Master Craftsman feats, but only for the purpose of making magic armor. 
Reckless You gain a +1 bonus on Acrobatics checks, and Acrobatics is always a class skill for you. 
Trustworthy You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks made to fool someone. You also gain a +1 trait bonus 
on Diplomacy checks, and Diplomacy is always a class skill for you. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +5 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using close weapons, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with close weapons, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when 
defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against close weapons. You receive a similar bonus 
with heavy blades, but only at a +4 bonus.
