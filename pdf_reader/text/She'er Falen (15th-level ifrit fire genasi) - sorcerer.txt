SPECIALABILITIES 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to 
fire. This also changes the spell’s type to fire. 
Blood Havoc Whenever you cast a sorcerer spell that deals damage, add 1 point of damage per die rolled. This 
benefit applies only to damaging spells that belong to schools you have selected with Spell Focus or that 
are bloodline spells for your bloodline. 

Elemental Affinity (Ex) You treat your Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class 
abilities. 
Elemental Blast (Sp) You can unleash a blast of elemental power once per day. This 20-foot-radius burst does 
23d6 points of fire damage. Those caught in the area of your blast receive a Reflex save (DC 30) for half 
damage. Creatures that fail their saves gain vulnerability to fire until the end of your next turn. This 
ability has a maximum range of 60 feet. (You are treated as eight levels higher than normal due to your 
favored class bonus and robe of arcane heritage.) 
Elemental Movement (Su) Your base speed increases by 30 feet (included above). 
Elemental Resistance (Ex) You gain fire resistance 20 due to your elemental heritage. 
Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage 
on a successful save, you instead take no damage. If you are helpless or are not wearing your ring of 
evasion, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Wildfire Heart You gain a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks.
