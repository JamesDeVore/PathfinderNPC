SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Cackle (Su) You can cackle madly as a move action. Any creature that is within 30 feet that is under the effects 
of an agony hex, charm hex, evil eye hex, fortune hex, or misfortune hex caused by you has the duration 
of that hex extended by 1 round. 
Cauldron (Ex) You receive Brew Potion as a bonus feat and a +4 insight bonus on Craft (alchemy) skill 
checks. 
Enhanced Familiar (Su) For the purposes of determining your familiar’s powers and abilities, you treat your 
familiar as if you were one level higher than your actual witch level. 
Evil Eye (Su) You can cause doubt to creep into the mind of a foe within 30 feet that you can see. The target 
takes a –4 penalty on one of the following (your choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, 
or skill checks. This hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. A Will 
save reduces this to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. 
Familiar Form (Sp) You may take the shape of your familiar (or a giant version of your familiar or a similar 
kind of animal) as if using beast shape II. For example, a witch with a rat familiar can turn into a Tiny 
rat, Small dire rat, or a larger rodent; one with a cat familiar can turn into a Tiny cat or a Large feline 
such as a tiger or lion; one with a monkey familiar can turn into a Tiny monkey or a Large gorilla, and 
so on. You can remain in animal form for a number of minutes per day equal to your witch level. 
Poisons You carry of variety of poisons, primarily for use with your poisoner’s glove: 
Burnt othur fumes—inhaled; save Fort DC 18, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1 Con drain/1d3 
Con, cure 2 consecutive saves. 
Dragon bile—contact; save Fort DC 26, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d3 Str, cure none. 
Oil of taggit—ingested; save Fort DC 15, onset 1 minute, effect unconsciousness for 1d3 hours, cure 1 
save. 
Transfer Feats (Ex) Whenever you are capable of learning a new feat, you may choose to instead have you 
familiar learn the feat as a bonus feat. The familiar must meet the prerequisites for any feats that it learns 
this way. If your familiar is lost or dies, you can reclaim the feat slots and select new feats for yourself, 
or apply the slots toward your new familiar.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Alertness (Ex) While your familiar is within arm’s reach, you gain the Alertness feat. 
Cat’s Luck (Su) A silvanshee adds its Charisma modifier as a luck bonus on all its saving throws. Once per day 
as a standard action, it can also grant this bonus to one ally within 30 feet for 10 minutes. 
Deliver Touch Spells (Su) If you and your familiar are in contact at the time you cast a touch spell, you can 
designate your familiar as the toucher. Your familiar can then deliver the touch spell personally. As 
usual, if you cast another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. 
Empathic Link (Su) Your familiar has an empathic link with you out to one mile. You cannot see through your 
familiar’s eyes, but the two of you can communicate empathically. Only general emotional content can 
be communicated. You have the same connection to an item or place that your familiar does. 
Heroic Strength (Su) Once per day, a silvanshee can grant itself a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength for 1 
minute. 
Improved Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, your familiar takes no damage if he makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if 
the saving throw fails. 
Share Spells Any spell you cast on yourself also affects your familiar if he is within 5 feet at the time of 
casting. If the spell is continuous, it stops affecting your familiar if he moves farther than 5 feet away. 
Your familiar may accept such spells even if he would normally be an invalid target. 
Spectral Mist (Su) A silvanshee can assume an eerie, mist-like form roughly the size and shape of a cat. This 
ability has the same effect as a gaseous form spell, except the silvanshee retains its own DR and 
supernatural abilities and can move at its normal speed. It can remain in mist form up to 5 minutes per 
day. This duration does not have to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.
