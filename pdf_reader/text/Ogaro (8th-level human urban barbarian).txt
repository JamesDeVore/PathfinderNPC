SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Clear Mind (Ex) You may reroll a failed Will save. This power is used as an immediate action after the first 
save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. You must take the second result, even 
if it is worse. This power can only be used once per rage. 
Controlled Rage (Ex) You can enter a controlled rage as a free action for 21 rounds each day. The total 
number of rounds of controlled rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do 
not need to be consecutive. While in a controlled rage, you may apply a +4 morale bonus to your 
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This bonus increases to +6 when you gain greater rage and +8 when 
you gain mighty rage. You may apply the full bonus to one ability score or may split the bonus between 
several scores in increments of +2. When using a controlled rage, you gain no bonus on Will saves, take 
no penalties to AC, and can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills. This ability 
otherwise follows the normal rules for rage. You can end your rage as a free action and you become 
fatigued afterwards for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. You 
cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a 
single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your rage immediately ends, placing you in peril of 
death. 

Crowd Control (Ex) You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC when adjacent to two or 
more enemies. In addition, your movement is not impeded by crowds, and you gain a bonus equal to ½ 
your barbarian level on Intimidate checks to influence crowds. 
Greater Guarded Life (Ex) While raging, if you are reduced below 0 hit points, 2 hit point of lethal damage 
per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. If you are at negative hit points due to lethal 
damage, you immediately stabilize. 
Guarded Stance (Ex) You gain a +2 dodge bonus to your Armor Class against melee attacks for a number of 
rounds equal to the barbarian’s current Constitution modifier (minimum 1). Activating this ability is a 
move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. 
Heart of the Wilderness You gain a bonus equal to ½ your character level on Survival checks. You also gain a 
+5 bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying and add ½ your character level to your 
Constitution score when determining the negative hit point total necessary to kill you. 
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC even if you are caught flat-footed or 
struck by an invisible attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. You 
cannot be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, 
unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. 
Trap Sense (Ex) You receive a +2 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +2 dodge bonus to AC 
against attacks made by traps.
