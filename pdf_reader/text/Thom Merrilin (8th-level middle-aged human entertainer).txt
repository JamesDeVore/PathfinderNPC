SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bardic Knowledge (Ex) You add half your class level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge skill checks and may 
make all Knowledge skill checks untrained. 
Bardic Performance: You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + your Charisma 
modifier. At each level after 1st you can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each 
round, you can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that you have mastered, as indicated 
by your level. Starting a bardic performance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a 
free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires you to stop the previous 
performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it 
ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented 
from taking a free action to maintain it each round. You cannot have more than one bardic performance 
in effect at one time. Each bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both. If a 
bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear you for the performance to 
have any effect, and such performances are language dependent. You have a 20% chance to fail when 
attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component while deaf. If you fail this check, the 
attempt still counts against your daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with 
audible components. If a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight 
to you for the performance to have any effect. You have a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a 
bardic performance with a visual component while blind. If you fail this check, the attempt still counts 
against your daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components. 
Countersong (Su) You can counter magic effects that depend on sound (but not spells that have verbal 
components). Each round of the countersong you make a Perform (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, 
or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of you (including yourself) that is affected by a sonic or 
language-dependent magical attack may use your Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, 
after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range 
of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent 
magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but 
it must use your Perform skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don't 
allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components. 
Dirge of Doom (Su) You can use your performance to foster a sense of growing dread in your enemies, causing 
them to become shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear your 
performance. The effect persists for as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and you continue your 
performance. This performance cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the 
targets are already shaken from another effect. Dirge of doom is a mind-affecting fear effect, and it 
relies on audible and visual components. 
Distraction (Su) You can use your performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of 
the distraction, you make a Perform (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 
feet of you (including yourself) that is affected by an illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical 
attack may use your Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, 
the Perform skill check proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the distraction is already under 
the effect of a non-instantaneous illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack, it gains another 
saving throw against the effect each round it sees the distraction, but it must use your Perform skill 
check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don't allow saves. Distraction relies 
on visual components. 

Fascinate (Su) You can use your performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with you. 
Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear you, and capable of paying 
attention to you. You must also be able to see the creatures affected. The distraction of a nearby combat 
or other dangers prevents this ability from working. For every three bard levels you have attained 
beyond 1st, you can target one additional creature with this ability. Each creature within range receives a 
Will save (DC 10 + ½ your bard level + your Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving 
throw succeeds, you cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, 
the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as you continue to maintain it. While 
fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on all skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. 
Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any 
obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, 
automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. 
Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function. 
Inspire Competence (Su) You can use your performance to help an ally succeed at a task. That ally must be 
within 30 feet and be able to hear you. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a 
particular skill as long as she continues to hear your performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every 
four bard levels you have attained beyond 3
rd (+3 at 7
th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th). Certain 
uses of this ability are infeasible, such as Stealth, and may be disallowed at the GM’s discretion. A bard 
can’t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence relies on audible components. 
Inspire Courage (Su) You can use your performance to inspire courage in your allies (including yourself), 
bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to 
perceive your performance. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm 
and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 5
th level, and every 
six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17
th level. Inspire courage 
is a mind-affecting ability. Inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The bard must choose 
which component to use when starting his performance. 
Lore Master (Ex) You can take 10 on any Knowledge skill check that you have ranks in. You can choose not 
to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, once per day, you can take 20 on any Knowledge 
skill check as a standard action. You can use this ability one additional time per day for every six levels 
he possesses beyond 5
th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th level. 
Suggestion (Sp) You can use your performance to make a suggestion (as per the spell) to a creature you have 
already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not disrupt the fascinate effect, but it does require 
a standard action to activate (in addition to the free action to continue the fascinate effect). You can use 
this ability more than once against an individual creature during an individual performance. Making a 
suggestion does not count against your daily use of bardic performance. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 
½ your bard level + your Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature. 
Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind affecting, language-dependent ability and relies on 
audible components. 
Versatile Performance (Ex) You can choose one type of Perform skill. You can use your bonus in that skill in 
place of your bonus in associated skills. When substituting in this way, you use your total Perform skill 
bonus, including class skill bonus, in place of its associated skill’s bonus, whether or not you have ranks 
in that skill or if it is a class skill. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you can select an additional 
type of Perform to substitute. 
Well-Versed (Ex) You become resistant to the bardic performance of others, and to sonic effects in general. 
You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, sonic, and language-dependent 
effects.
