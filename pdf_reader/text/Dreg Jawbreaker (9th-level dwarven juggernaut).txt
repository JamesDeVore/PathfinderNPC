SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Armor Training (Ex) When wearing armor, you reduce your armor check penalty by 2 (to a minimum of 0) 
and increase your armor’s maximum Dexterity modifier limit by 2 (included above).

that contain precious metals or gemstones (not included above). 
Hardy You receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, spells, and spell-like abilities (not 
included above). 
Hatred You receive a +1 bonus on attack rolls against Humanoid creatures of the Orc and Goblinoid subtypes 
due to special training against these hated foes (not included above). 
Stability You receive a +4 racial bonus to your Combat Maneuver Defense when resisting a bull rush or trip

Stonecunning You receive a +2 bonus on Perception checks to potentially notice unusual stonework, such as

whenever you pass within 10 feet of them, whether or not you are actively looking (not included above). 
Warrior Spirit (Su) Each day, you may designate one weapon in the hammer group and gain a number of 
points of spiritual energy equal to 1 + your weapon training bonus. While wielding this weapon, you can 

spend 1 point of spiritual energy to grant the weapon an enhancement bonus equal to your weapon 
training bonus. Enhancement bonuses gained by this advanced weapon training option stack with those 
of the weapon, to a maximum of +5. You can also imbue the weapon with any one weapon special 
ability with an equivalent enhancement bonus less than or equal to his maximum bonus by reducing the 
granted enhancement bonus by the amount of the equivalent enhancement bonus. The item must have an 
enhancement bonus of at least +1 (from the item itself or from warrior spirit) to gain a weapon special 
ability. In either case, these bonuses last for 1 minute. 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with battleaxes, heavy picks, and warhammers, and treat any weapon 
with the word “dwarven” in its name as a martial weapon. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using hammers, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with hammers, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when defending 
against disarm and sunder attempts made against hammers.
