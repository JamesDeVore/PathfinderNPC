SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Arcane Training You can use spell trigger and spell completion items for your favored class as if one level 
higher. 
Aspect (Su) You can divert up to 2 points from your eidolon’s evolution pool to add evolutions to yourself. 
You cannot select any evolution that the eidolon could not possess, and you must be able to meet the 

requirements as well. You cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points 
spent in this way are taken from the eidolon’s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the 
eidolon). You can change the evolutions you receive from these points any time you can change the 
eidolon’s evolutions. 
Bond Senses (Su) You can, as a standard action, share the senses of your eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, 
tasting, and touching everything the eidolon does. You can use this ability 15 rounds per day. There is 
no range to this effect, but you and your eidolon must be on the same plane. You may end the effect as a 
free action. 
Greater Shield Ally (Su) When an ally is within your eidolon’s reach, the ally receives a +2 shield bonus to its 
Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. These bonuses increase to +4 if the ally 
in question is you. This bonus does not apply if the eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or 
unconscious. 
Life Bond (Su) As long as the eidolon has 1 or more hit points, you cannot be killed. Damage in excess of that 
which would kill you is instead transferred to the eidolon. This damage is transferred 1 point at a time, 
meaning that as soon as the eidolon is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its 
Constitution score, all excess damage remains with you, killing you. Effects that cause death but not 
damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells like baleful polymorph, flesh to 
stone, or imprisonment, or other spells that do not cause actual damage. 
Life Link (Su) When the eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, you can, as a free 
action, sacrifice any number of hit points. Each hit point sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of 
damage done to the eidolon. This can prevent the eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. In 
addition, you and the eidolon must remain within 100 feet of one another for the eidolon to remain at 
full strength. If the eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit 
point totals are reduced by 50%. If the eidolon is more than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, 
its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 75%. If the eidolon is more than 10,000 feet 
away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. Current hit points lost in this way are not restored 
when the eidolon gets closer to you, but its maximum hit point total does return to normal. 
Maker’s Call (Su) Three times per day, as a standard action, you may call your eidolon to your side. This 
functions as dimension door, using your summoner caster level. When used, the eidolon appears 
adjacent to you (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If the eidolon is out of range, 
the ability is wasted. 
Transposition (Su) You can use your maker’s call ability to swap locations with your eidolon. If it is larger 
than you, you can appear in any square occupied by the eidolon. The eidolon must occupy the square 
that was occupied by you if able, or as close as possible if it is not able. 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, 
and shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word “elven” in its name 
as a martial weapon.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Constrict (Ex) Salamander can crush an opponent, dealing 4d6+10 bludgeoning damage when she makes a 
successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including 
additional damage). 
Devotion (Ex) Salamander receives a +4 morale bonus on Will saves versus enchantment spells and effects.

B, tail slap), scent, swim, tailF, tail slapF, tentacles (2) 
Grab (Ex) If Salamander hits with her tail slap attack, she deals normal damage and may attempt to start a 
grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. She may only grab Large or smaller 
creatures in this manner. She may conduct the grapple normally, or simply use her tail to hold the 
opponent. If she chooses to do the latter, she takes a –20 penalty on her CMB check to make and 
maintain the grapple, but she does not gain the grappled condition herself. A successful grapple check 
made to maintain the grab deals tail slap damage in addition to constriction damage as well. 
Improved Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, Salamander takes no damage if she makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if 
the saving throw fails. 

Link You and your eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as 
you are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing you to give orders to your 
eidolon at any time. What’s more, magic items interfere with this link, so that you and your eidolon 
must share magic item slots. When both you and the eidolon are wearing a magic item in the same slot, 
your magic item continues to function while the eidolon’s becomes dormant. An eidolon must still have 
the appropriate magical item slot in order to be able to use of a given magic item. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your eidolon (as a spell with a range of 
touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your eidolon even if the spells normally do not 
affect creatures of the eidolon’s type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner 
spell list. This ability does not allow your eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they 
function like spells.
