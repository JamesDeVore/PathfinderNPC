SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Abundant Step (Su) You can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door. Using this 
ability is a move action that consumes 2 points from your ki pool. Your caster level for this effect is 
equal to your monk level. You cannot take other creatures with you when you use this ability. 
AC Bonus (Ex) When unarmored and unencumbered, you add your Wisdom bonus +5 to your AC and your 
CMD (included above). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when you are 
flat-footed. You lose these bonuses when you are immobilized or helpless, when you wear any armor, or 
when you carry a shield or medium or greater load. 
Diamond Body (Su) You gain immunity to poisons of all kinds. 
Diamond Soul (Ex) You gain spell resistance equal to your current monk level + 10. 

Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage 
on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light 
armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Fast Movement (Ex) If wearing no armor and not carrying a medium load, you gain a +50 enhancement bonus 
to your base land speed. 
Flurry of Blows (Ex) You can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When doing so you may make 
three additional attacks using any combination of unarmed strikes or attacks with a special monk as if 
using the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat (even if you do not meet the prerequisites for the feat). For 
the purpose of these attacks, your base attack bonus is equal to your monk level. For all other purposes, 
such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, you use your normal base attack bonus. You apply your 
full Strength bonus to your damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, whether 
the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands. You may substitute 
disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows. You cannot 
use any weapon other than an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows. You 
cannot use natural weapons as part of a flurry of blows, nor can you make natural attacks in addition to 
your flurry of blows attacks. 
High Jump (Ex) You add your monk level to all Acrobatics checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and 
horizontal jumps (included above). In addition, you always count as having a running start when making 
jump checks using Acrobatics. By spending 1 point from your ki pool as a swift action, you gain a +20 
bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for 1 round. 
Ki Pool (Su) You gain ki points equal to half your monk level + your Wis modifier. As long as you have at 
least 1 point in your ki pool, you can make a ki strike. Your ki strike allows your unarmed attacks to be 
treated as magic and lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. By spending 1 
point from your ki pool, you can make one additional attack at your highest attack bonus when making a 
flurry of blows attack. In addition, you can spend 1 point to increase your speed by 20 feet for 1 round. 
Finally, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to give yourself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. 
Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours 
of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. 
Maneuver Training (Ex) You use your monk level in place of your base attack bonus when calculating your 
Combat Maneuver Bonus (included above). Base attack bonuses granted from other classes are 
unaffected and are added normally. 
Perfect Strike (Ex) You gain Perfect Strike as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites. You can 
roll your attack roll three times and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, you can 
choose which one of your other two rolls to use as his confirmation roll. 
Purity of Body (Ex) You gain immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases. 
Quivering Palm (Su) You can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal 
if you so desire. You can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and you must announce your 
intent before making your attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if 
you strike successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. 
Thereafter, you can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a 
number of days equal to your monk level. To make such an attempt, you merely will the target to die (a 
free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + ½ your monk level + your 
Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that 
particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. You can have 
no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If you use quivering palm while another is still in 
effect, the previous effect is negated. 
Slow Fall (Ex) When within arm’s reach of a wall you can use it to slow your descent. You take damage as if 
the fall were 70 feet shorter than it actually is. 
Unarmed Strike You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. Your attacks may be with fist, elbows, 
knees, and feet. This means that you may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such 
thing as an off-hand attack for you. You may apply your full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all of 
your unarmed strikes. Usually your unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but you can choose to deal 

nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on your attack roll. You have the same choice to deal lethal or 
nonlethal damage while grappling. Your unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a 
natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured 
weapons or natural weapons. You deal more damage with your unarmed strikes than a normal person 
would, as shown above. 
Way of the Weapon Master (Ex) You gain Weapon Focus as a bonus feat with one of your monk weapons. 
Additionally you gain Weapon Specialization with the same weapon as the bonus feat, even if you do 
not meet the prerequisites. 
Wholeness of Body (Su) You can heal your own wounds as a standard action. You can heal a number of hit 
points of damage equal to your monk level by using 2 points from your ki pool.
