SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Animal Fury (Ex) While raging, you gain a bite attack. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is 
made at your full base attack bonus –5. If the bite hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage plus half of your 
Strength modifier. You can make a bite attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a 
grapple. This attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the bite attack hits, any grapple 
checks you make against the target this round are at a +2 bonus. 
Bandit You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks, and Stealth is always a class skill for you. 
Breathtaker (Ex) While raging, whenever you make a successful melee attack against an opponent that is 
holding its breath, in addition to any other effects caused by that attack, the opponent loses a number of 
rounds of breath equal to your Strength modifier. 
Eyes of the Storm (Ex) You ignore any concealment provided by fog, rain, sleet, mist, wind, or other weather 
effects that are less than total concealment, and any penalties weather applies on Perception checks are 
halved. 

Marine Terror (Ex) You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution 
score. In addition, you can move normally though squares of standing water or bog that is 1 foot deep. It 
does not cost you extra movement to traverse these terrains. Lastly, you ignore the normal cover bonus 
to AC when attacking creatures that are partially immersed in water. 
Rage (Ex) You can enter a rage as a free action for 23 rounds each day. The total number of rounds of rage per 
day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in 
rage, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on 
Will saves. In addition, you take a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution grants you 2 
hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like temporary hit 
points. While in rage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except 
Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration. You can end 
your rage as a free action and you become fatigued afterwards for a number of rounds equal to 2 times 
the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted but can 
otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If you fall unconscious, your 
rage immediately ends, placing you in peril of death. 
Savage Jaw (Ex) While using the animal fury rage power, you can activate this power as a free action and gain 
the grab ability with your bite attack until the start of your next turn. This power can be used only once 
per rage. 
Savage Sailor (Ex) You gain a +3 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Profession (sailor), Survival, and Swim checks 
made in aquatic terrain, including aboard a ship or along shorelines. 
Serpentine Squeeze You gain a +1 trait bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe, as well as a +1 
trait bonus to your CMD whenever an opponent tries to grapple you. 
Strength Surge (Ex) Once per rage, you may add your barbarian level on one Strength check or combat 
maneuver check, or to your Combat Maneuver Defense when an opponent attempts a maneuver against 
you. This power is used as an immediate action. 
Sure-Footed (Ex) You take no penalties when moving across slick surfaces, whether natural or magical (e.g., 
grease, ice storm, and sleet storm). You are not at risk of falling, are not denied your Dexterity bonus 
when moving across such areas, and do not treat them as difficult terrain.
