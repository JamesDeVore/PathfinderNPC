SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Channel (Su) You can channel positive energy like a cleric, using your oracle level +1 as your effective cleric 
level when determining the amount of damage healed (or caused to undead) and the DC. You can use 
this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. 
Charismatic As a variant aasimar, you gain a +6 racial bonus to Charisma, rather than +2. Unlike normal 
aasimar, you have no spell-like abilities. 
Enhanced Cures (Su) Whenever you cast a cure spell, the maximum number of hit points healed is based on 
your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell. 
Life Link (Su) As a standard action, you may create a bond between yourself and another creature. Each round 

at the start of your turn, if the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum 
hit points, it heals 5 hit points and you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have one bond active per 
oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and 
the other creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have multiple 
bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same immediate action). 
Oracle’s Curse: Deaf You cannot hear and suffer all of the usual penalties for being deafened. You cast all of 
your spells as if they were modified by the Silent Spell feat. This does not increase their level or casting 
time. You receive a +3 competence bonus on Perception checks that do not rely upon hearing, and the 
initiative penalty for being deaf is reduced to –2.
