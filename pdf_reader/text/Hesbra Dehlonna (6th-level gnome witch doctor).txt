SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Channel Energy (Su) Four times per day you may release a burst of positive energy in a 30-ft. radius burst as a 
standard action. When doing so you can choose to harm undead creatures in the area (3d6 damage, Will 
DC 16 half) or to heal the living (3d6 healing). 
Gnome Magic You add +1 to the DC of any saving throws against illusion spells that you cast. If you have a 
Charisma score of 11 or higher you also gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day—dancing lights, 

ghost sound, prestidigitation, and speak with animals. The caster level for these effects is equal to your 
character level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell’s level + your Charisma modifier. 
Spirit Magic You can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those you prepared ahead 
of time. You have one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level you can cast, not including orisons. 
You can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by your spirits at the time you cast them. You 
can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that you know, using up a higher-level spell slot as 
required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell. 
Storm Burst (Su) As a standard action, you can cause a small storm of swirling wind and rain to form around 
one creature within 30 feet. This storm causes the target to treat all foes as if they had concealment, 
suffering a 20% miss chance for 1 round plus 1 round for every 4 shaman levels you possess. You can 
use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. 
Warden of Nature You gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against aberrations, oozes, and vermin, and a +1 bonus 
on attack rolls against them because of your special training against such creatures. 
Weapon Familiarity You treat any weapon with the word “gnome” in its name as a martial weapon.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Natural Diver (Ex) Armadillos can hold their breath underwater for up to 6 minutes. Their dense armor 
naturally causes them to sink; they can inflate their stomachs to counter this, accounting for their racial 
bonus on Swim checks. 
Protective Ball (Ex) Some armadillos can roll up into a ball, increasing their natural armor bonus to +3 but 
decreasing their speed to 0.
