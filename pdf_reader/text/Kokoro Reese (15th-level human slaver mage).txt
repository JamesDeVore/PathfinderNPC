SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bonded Object (Sp) If you attempt to cast a spell without your bonded object worn or in hand, you must make 
a concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. A 
bonded object can be used once per day to cast any one spell that you have in your spellbook and are 
capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by you, 
including casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on your caster level. This spell cannot be 
modified by metamagic feats or other abilities. The bonded object cannot be used to cast spells from 
your opposition schools. The magic properties of your bonded object, including any magic abilities 
added to the object, only function for you. 
Dazing Touch (Sp) You can cause a living creature to become dazed for 1 round as a melee touch attack. 
Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected. You can use this ability a number 
of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. 
Force of Will (Su) You can send thoughts and instructions telepathically to any creature within 60 feet that you 
have charmed or dominated as though you shared a common language. Affected creatures can 
communicate back to you via the telepathic link as well. 
Irresistible Demand (Sp) You can force others to do your bidding. As a standard action, you attempt to 
dominate a creature as though using the dominate monster spell, except that the creature must have a 
number of Hit Dice equal to or less than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a Will saving 
throw each round to negate the effect. The DC is equal to 10 + ½ your wizard level + your Intelligence 
modifier. You can dominate creatures for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These 
rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must concentrate as a standard action to maintain control 
over a dominated creature.
