SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Among Humans You gain a +2 trait bonus on Disguise checks to appear human while assuming your specific 
human form with the change shape racial trait, and Disguise is always a class skill for you. 
Change Shape (Su) You can assume the appearance of a specific single human form of the same sex. You 
always takes this specific form when you use this ability. While in human form you cannot use your bite 
attack, but you gain a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to appear human. Changing shape is a 
standard action. This ability otherwise functions as alter self, except that you do not adjust your ability 
scores and can remain in this form indefinitely. 
Channel Energy (Su) You may release a burst of positive energy in a 30-ft. radius burst as a standard action. 
When doing so you can choose to harm undead creatures in the area (10d6 damage, Will DC 22 half) or 
to heal living creatures in the area (10d6 healing). You can use this ability a number of times per day 
equal to 2 + double your Charisma modifier. 
Enhanced Cures (Su) When you cast a cure spell, the maximum number of hit points healed is based on your 
oracle level, not the limit imposed by the spell. 
Fast Talker You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks, and Bluff is always a class skill for you. 
Gregarious (Ex) Whenever you successfully use Diplomacy to win over an individual, that creature takes a –2 
penalty to resist any of your Charisma-based skill checks for the next 24 hours. 
Healer’s Touch (Su) You gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks. As a standard action, you can move up to half your 
speed and touch up to six dying creatures. Each creature is automatically stabilized without the need of a 
Heal check. 
Lifesense (Su) You notice and locate living creatures within 30 feet, just as if you possessed the blindsight 
ability. 
Ongoing Spells The following spells are regularly active upon your person, your gear, or your allies, as 
appropriate: greater magic weapon (blade, crossbow, and whip), magic vestment (armor and shield), 
freedom of movement (when expecting combat), shield other (on one ally), and status (on allies). All 
ongoing spell effects function at 15th-caster level (and thus require a DC 26 caster level check to dispel) 
and their effects are included in the above stats where appropriate. 
Wrecking Mysticism The duration of any poison, sickened condition, or nauseated condition affecting you is 
increased by 50%. Whenever you would gain a mystery spell, you can gain Magical Tail as a bonus feat 
instead. Once this choice has been made, it cannot be changed. You cannot replace a bonus spell granted 
to you by an oracle archetype with Magical Tail, even if it replaces a mystery spell. Add magic jar, 
minor image, project image, and ventriloquism to your list of spells known.
