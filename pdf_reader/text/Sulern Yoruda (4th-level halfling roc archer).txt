SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Aquatic Adaptation (Ex) You gain an insight bonus on Initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), 
Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks equal to ½ your druid level in aquatic terrain, and you 
cannot be tracked such environments. 
Nature Sense (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus to knowledge: nature checks and Survival checks (included above). 
Resist Ocean’s Fury (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells of the water type or the 
exceptional or supernatural abilities of creatures with the aquatic or water subtype. 
Wild Empathy (Ex) You can improve the attitude of any creature with a swim speed or the aquatic or water 
subtype (even if they are mindless). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve 
the attitude of a person. You roll 1d20 and add your druid level and your Charisma modifier to 
determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of 
indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, you and the creature must 
be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a creature in this way 
takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

Encumbrance light 50 lb., medium 100 lb., heavy 150 lb.; Weight Carried 0 lb. 
SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Link (Ex) You can handle your animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if you 
don’t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy 
checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your animal companion (as a spell with a 
range of touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your animal companion even if the spells 
normally do not affect creatures of the companion’s type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come 
from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities 
that are not spells, even if they function like spells. 
 
KIT BREAKDOWN 
This kit consists of a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a clay mug, a dagger, two fishhooks, a flint and steel, a 
sewing needle, a signal whistle, 50 feet of string, 50 feet of thread, a waterskin, a week's worth of trail rations, 
and a whetstone. Leaving the bedroll and rations at camp or on a mount reduces the weight by 3 pounds.
