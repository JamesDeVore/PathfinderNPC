SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Armor Training (Ex) When wearing armor, you reduce your armor check penalty by 3 (to a minimum of 0) 
and increase your armor’s maximum Dexterity modifier limit by 3. In addition, your speed is not 
reduced for wearing medium or heavy armor. 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +3 bonus on Will saves against fear effects. 
Exalted Resistance You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your level against spells and spell-like abilities with 
the evil descriptor, as well as any spells and spell-like abilities cast by evil outsiders. 
Halo You possess the ability to manifest a halo. You can create light centered on your head at will as a spell-
like ability. When using your halo, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks against evil 
creatures and on saving throws against becoming blinded or dazzled. 
Weapon Sacrifice (Ex) When damage would cause you or an adjacent ally to be knocked unconscious or 
killed, as a swift or immediate action you can instead direct the damage to a weapon from the associated 
weapon group that you are wielding. The original target takes no damage, but the weapon receives only 

half its normal hardness. You can use this option a number of times per day equal to your weapon 
training bonus with the associated weapon group.  
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +5 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using bows, to any combat 
maneuver checks made with bows, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against 
disarm and sunder attempts made against bows. You receive a similar bonus with heavy blades, but only 
at +4.
