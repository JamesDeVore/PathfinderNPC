SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Brutally Weighted Club A creature hit with a brutally weighted weapon takes a –2 penalty to its CMD against 
bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers until the end of its next turn or until after it is subject to 
such a maneuver (whichever comes first). 
Camouflage (Ex) You can use the Stealth skill to hide in forest terrain, even if the terrain doesn’t grant cover or 
concealment. 
Exploit Weakness (Ex) You add one-third of your fighter class level on attack rolls to confirm critical hits. 

Favored Terrain (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, 
Stealth, and Survival skill checks when you are in forest terrain. When traveling through forests, you 
normally leave no trail and cannot be tracked (though you may leave a trail if you so desire). You gain 
similar bonuses and benefits in jungle terrain, but only at a +2 bonus. If a specific terrain falls into more 
than one category of favored terrain, these bonuses do not stack; you simply use whichever bonus is 
higher. 
Massmorph (Sp) As a full-round action, you can alter the size and health of plant life, as if using plant growth 
or diminish plants. 
Photosynthesis (Ex) You feed upon nature’s raw essence. Your need to eat and sleep is reduced as if wearing a 
ring of sustenance, and you gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws made against poison and sleep 
effects. 
Scholastic (Ex) You gain 2 additional skill ranks each level. These ranks must be spent on Intelligence-based 
skills. All Craft and Knowledge skills are class skills for you, as are Linguistics and Spellcraft. 
Skill Over Strength (Ex) You gain Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if you would not normally qualify 
for the feat. You treat your base attack bonus as though it were 2 higher for the purposes of calculating 
the effects of Combat Expertise. 
Tanglevine (Sp) As a standard action, you can create a 15-foot-long, animated vine that springs from your 
hand. This vine lasts for 1 round and can be used to make a single disarm, steal, or trip combat 
maneuver, using your effective sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier in place of your normal 
CMB. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using hammers, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with hammers, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when defending 
against disarm and sunder attempts made against hammers. You gain a similar bonus with bows, but 
only at a +3 bonus.
