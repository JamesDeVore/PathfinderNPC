SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Alchemy (Su) When using Craft (alchemy) to create an alchemical item, you gain a competence bonus equal to 
your alchemist class level on the Craft (alchemy) check (included above). In addition, you can use Craft 
(alchemy) to identify potions as if using detect magic. You must hold the potion for 1 round to make 
such a check. You are also capable of creating bombs, extracts, and mutagens (see below). 
Bomb (Su) You can use a number of bombs each day equal to your alchemist class level + your Intelligence 
modifier. Bombs are unstable, and if not used in the round they are created, they degrade and become 
inert—their method of creation prevents large volumes of explosive material from being created and 
stored. Creating and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. 
Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and use the Throw Splash Weapon special attack. Bombs are 
considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a 
direct hit, your bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage plus additional damage equal to your 

Intelligence modifier (due to the throw anything class ability). The damage of your bomb increases by 
1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit 
or by using feats such as Vital Strike). Splash damage from an alchemist bomb is always equal to the 
bomb’s minimum damage. Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a Reflex save DC 20 for half 
damage. 
Brutality (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls when attacking with natural attacks or simple weapons 
(included above). 
Evasion (Ex) You can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If you make a successful 
Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead 
takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor and are in your 
mutagenic form. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Explosive Bomb Your bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a direct 
hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is 
extinguished. Extinguishing the f lames is a full round action that requires a Reflex save (DC 20). 
Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons 
of water automatically extinguishes the flames. 
Extracts (Su) You may create and use extracts, essentially spells in the form a drinkable liquid. For the most 
part, extracts follow the rules of both potions and spells. 
Greater Mutagen (Su) You may brew a dose of mutagen in 1 hour, and once brewed, it remains potent until 
used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time—if you brew a second dose, any existing 
mutagen becomes inert. As with an extract or bomb, a mutagen that is not in your possession becomes 
inert until you pick it up again. When you brew a mutagen, you select two physical ability scores—
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It’s a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the 
mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +4 natural armor bonus and a +6 
alchemical bonus to one selected ability score and a +4 alchemical bonus to the second ability score for 
10 minutes per alchemist level. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a –2 penalty to two 
of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your 
Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your 
Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a 
DC 20 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour—a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a 
mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist’s mutagen if he drinks it. (Although 
if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the “stolen” mutagen immediately 
cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever you drink a mutagen, the effects of any 
previous mutagen immediately end. 
Infuse Mutagen When you create a mutagen, you can infuse it with an extra bit of your own magical power. 
This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to you and costs 1,000gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen 
created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if you create another mutagen. This allows you to 
create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow you to 
gain the effects of multiple mutagens—only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect. 
Mutagenic Form (Ex) You have two identities, that of your normal form, and that of your mutagenic form. 
Though statistically the same, each identity has a differing alignments and differing ways of 
accomplishing their goals. Alignment effects effect you based on whatever alignment/personality you 
have at that time. 
Mutate (Su) Three times per day as, you may change form (as per your mutagen class ability) without imbibing 
a mutagen. Using a mutagen also forces you into this form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability 
again while in your mutagenic form works normally (with the new mutagen’s modifiers replacing the 
current modifiers, and the longer duration taking precedent). You remain in your mutagenic form until 
its duration expires, your magic is interrupted (as with an antimagic field), or you expend another use of 
your mutate ability. You may be forced to take your mutagenic form against your will by stress or 
damage. Anytime you are in your normal form and have daily uses of the mutate ability available, you 
may be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a Fortitude save. In these situations you 

must make a DC 25 Will save; if you fail, on your next turn you use a standard action to change to your 
mutagenic form (which counts as a use of the mutate ability). 
Nimble (Ex) In addition to the above effects, you mutagenic form grants you an alchemical bonus on all 
Dexterity checks, Dexterity skill checks, and CMD, and a natural armor bonus to your Armor Class. The 
bonus is equal to half your master chymist class levels. 
Poison Use (Ex) You are trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison yourself when applying 
poison to a weapon. 
Poisons You carry of variety of poisons, which you typically coat your bladed weapons with: 
Dragon bile—contact; save Fort DC 26, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d3 Str, cure none. 
Nightmare vapor—inhaled; save Fort DC 20, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1 Wis and confused 
for 1 round, cure 2 consecutive saves. 
Oil of taggit—ingested; save Fort DC 15, onset 1 minute, effect unconsciousness for 1d3 hours, cure 1 
save. 
Precise Bombs Whenever you throw a bomb, you can select a number of squares equal to your Intelligence 
modifier that are not affected by the splash damage from your bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery 
has no effect. 
Swift Alchemy (Ex) You can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes you half the normal 
amount of time to create alchemical items. 
Swift Poisoning (Ex) You can apply a dose of poison to a weapon as a swift action. 
Throw Anything (Ex) You gain the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat and you add your Intelligence 
modifier to damage done with splash weapons, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage 
is already included in the bomb class feature (and in the above stats).
