 SPECIALABILITIES 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to fire. 
This also changes the spell’s type to fire. 
Elemental Affinity (Ex) You treat your Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. 
Elemental Blast (Sp) You can unleash a blast of elemental power three times per day. This 20-foot-radius burst does 
28d6 points of fire damage. Those caught in the area of your blast receive a Reflex save (DC 36) for half 
damage. Creatures that fail their saves gain vulnerability to fire until the end of your next turn. This ability has 
a maximum range of 60 feet. (You are treated as eight levels higher than normal due to your favored class 
bonus and robe of arcane heritage.) 
Elemental Body (Su) You gain immunity to sneak attacks, critical hits, and fire damage. 
Elemental Movement (Su) Your base speed increases by 30 feet (included above). 
Elemental Ray (Sp) Twelve times per day you can unleash an elemental ray as a standard action, targeting any foe 
within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d6+14 points of fire damage. (You are treated as eight 
levels higher than normal due to your favored class bonus and robe of arcane heritage.) 
Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a 
successful save, you instead take no damage. If you are helpless or are not wearing your ring of evasion, you do 
not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Wildfire Heart You gain a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks.
