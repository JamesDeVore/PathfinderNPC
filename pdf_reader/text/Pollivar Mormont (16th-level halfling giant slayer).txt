checks to demoralize you increases by an amount equal to twice your bonus from bravery. 
Armor Training (Ex) Whenever you wear armor, you reduce the armor check penalty by 4 (to a minimum of 
0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by your armor by 4. Additionally, you can also 
move at your normal speed while wearing medium or heavy armor. 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +5 bonus on Will saves against fear. 
Fearless You receive a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws against fear. 
Fleet of Foot You have a base speed of 30 feet, rather than 20 feet. 
Low Blow You gain a +1 bonus on critical confirmation rolls against opponents larger than yourself. 

Underfoot You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against foes larger than yourself (not included above) and a +1 
bonus on Reflex saving throws to avoid trample attacks. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +5 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using axes, to any combat 
maneuver checks made with axes, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against 
disarm and sunder attempts made against axes. You get similar bonuses with bows, but only at +4.
