SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you apply a metamagic feat to a spell that increases the slot used by at least one 
level, increase the spell’s DC by +1. This bonus does not stack with itself and does not apply to spells 
modified by the Heighten Spell feat. 
Flesh to Stone Your flesh to stone spell has a DC of 35 and a caster level of 22 (or 30 for overcoming spell 
resistance) when cast with any metamagic feat. 
Metamagic Adept (Ex) Five times per day you can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell you are 
about to cast without increasing the casting time. You must still expend a higher-level spell slot to cast 
this spell. 
Ongoing Spells The following spells are regularly active upon your person: ant haul, false life, mage 
armor, overland flight, and statue. She has also used shrink item upon her sorcerer’s kit and medusion to 
reduce their weight. All ongoing spell effects function at 15
th-caster level (and thus require a DC 26 
caster level check to dispel) and their effects are included in the above stats where appropriate. 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with slings and treat any weapon with the word “halfling” in its name 
as a martial weapon.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Alertness (Ex) While your familiar is within arm’s reach, you gain the Alertness feat. 
Deliver Touch Spells (Su) If you and your familiar are in contact at the time you cast a touch spell, you can 
designate your familiar as the toucher. Your familiar can then deliver the touch spell personally. As 
usual, if you cast another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. 
Empathic Link (Su) Your familiar has an empathic link with you out to one mile. You cannot see through your 
familiar’s eyes, but the two of you can communicate empathically. Only general emotional content can 
be communicated. You have the same connection to an item or place that your familiar does. 
Improved Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half 
damage, your familiar takes no damage if he makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if 
the saving throw fails. 
Scry On Familiar (Sp) Once per day you may scry on your familiar, as if using the scry spell. 
Share Spells You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your familiar (as a touch spell) instead of on 
yourself. You may cast spells on your familiar even if the spells do not normally affect creatures of the 
familiar’s type (magical beast). 
Speak with Rodents (Ex) Your familiar may communicate with other rodents. Such communication is limited 
by the Intelligence of the conversing creatures. 
Speak With Master (Ex) You and your familiar may communicate verbally, using a private language no one 
else understands.
