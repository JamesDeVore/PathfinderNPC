SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Claws (Ex/Su) You can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you 
to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. Each of these attacks 
deals 1d6 points of damage plus your Strength modifier plus 1d6 fire damage (the fire damage is 
considered a supernatural ability). These claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of 
overcoming DR. You can use your claws for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma 
modifier. 
Power of Giants (Sp) You may grow to Large size as a standard action. At this size you gain a +6 size bonus to 
Strength, a –2 penalty to Dexterity, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, and a +4 natural armor bonus. You 
may return to your normal size as a standard action. You may remain in this size for up to 1 minute per 
character level per day; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1 minute 
increments. 
Sacred Tattoo You gain a +1 luck bonus to all saves (included above). 
Shaman’s Apprentice Due to your stalwart ability to survive the years of harsh treatment that an 
apprenticeship to an orc shaman entails, you gain Endurance as a bonus feat. 
Strength of the Beast (Ex) You gain a +4 inherent bonus to your Strength (included above). 
Weapon Familiarity You are always proficient with greataxes and falchions, and treat any weapon with the 
word “orc” in its name as a martial weapon.
