SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Evasion (Ex) You can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If you make a successful Reflex saving 
throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no 
damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. You do not gain the 
benefit of evasion when helpless. 
Fused Eidolon You can wear your eidolon like translucent, living armor. The eidolon mimics all of your 
movements, and you perceive through the eidolon’s senses and speak through its voice, as the two of 
you are now one creature. While fused with your eidolon, you use the eidolon’s Strength, Dexterity, and 
Constitution scores, but retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You gain the 
eidolon’s hit points as temporary hit points. When these hit points reach 0, the eidolon is killed and sent 
back to its home plane. You use the eidolon’s base attack bonus, and gain the eidolon’s armor and 
natural armor bonuses and modifiers to ability scores. You also gain access to the eidolon’s special 
abilities and the eidolon’s evolutions. You are still limited to the eidolon’s maximum number of natural 
attacks. The eidolon has no skills or feats of its own. The eidolon must be at least the same size as you. 

The eidolon must have limbs for you to cast spells with somatic components. The eidolon’s temporary 
hit points can be restored with the rejuvenate eidolon spell. While fused, you lose the benefits of your 
armor. You count both as your original type and as an outsider for any effect related to type, whichever 
is worse for you. Spells such as banishment or dismissal work normally on the eidolon, but you are 
unaffected. Neither you nor your eidolon can be targeted separately, as you are fused into one creature. 
You and your eidolon cannot take separate actions. While fused with your eidolon, you can use all of 
your own abilities and gear, except for your armor. In all other cases, this ability functions as the 
summoner’s normal eidolon ability (for example, you cannot use your summon monster ability while the 
eidolon is present). 
Fused Link (Su) Whenever the temporary hit points from your eidolon would be reduced to 0, you can, as a 
free action, sacrifice any number of your own hit points. Each hit point sacrificed this way prevents 1 
point of damage done to your eidolon (thus preventing the loss of your temporary hit points), preventing 
your eidolon from being sent back to its home plane. 
Fuse Style (Ex) You can fuse two of the styles you know into a more perfect style. You can have two style feat 
stances active at once. Starting a stance provided by a style feat is still a swift action, but when you 
switch to another style feat, you can choose one style whose stance is already active to persist. You may 
only have two style feat stances active at a time. 
Maker’s Jump (Sp) Whenever you are fused with your eidolon, you can cast dimension door as a spell-like 
ability using your caster level. This ability only affects you and your eidolon. You can use this ability 
only once per day. 
Shielded Meld (Ex) Whenever you are fused with your eidolon, you gain a +2 shield bonus to your Armor 
Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on your saving throws.

Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, your 
eidolon takes no damage if she makes a successful saving throw. 

Link You and your eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as 
you are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing you to give orders to your 
eidolon at any time. What’s more, magic items interfere with this link, so that you and your eidolon 
must share magic item slots. When both you and the eidolon are wearing a magic item in the same slot, 
your magic item continues to function while the eidolon’s becomes dormant. An eidolon must still have 
the appropriate magical item slot in order to be able to use of a given magic item. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your eidolon (as a spell with a range of 
touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your eidolon even if the spells normally do not 
affect creatures of the eidolon’s type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner 
spell list. This ability does not allow your eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they 
function like spells.
