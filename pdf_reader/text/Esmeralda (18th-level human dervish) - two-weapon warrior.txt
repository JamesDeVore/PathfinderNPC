SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +5 bonus on Will saves against fear effects (included above). 
Defensive Flurry (Ex) When you make a full attack with both weapons, you gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC 
against melee attacks until the beginning of your next turn. 
Deft Doublestrike (Ex) When you hit an opponent with both weapons, you can make a disarm or sunder 
attempt (or trip, if one or both weapons can be used to trip) against that opponent as an immediate action 
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. 
Doublestrike (Ex) You may, as a standard action, make one attack with both your primary and secondary 
weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally. 
Equal Opportunity (Ex) When you make an attack of opportunity, you may attack once with both your 
primary and secondary weapons. The penalties for attacking with two weapons apply normally. 
Improved Balance (Ex) The attack penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by –1 for you. 
Alternatively, you may use a one-handed weapon in your off-hand, treating it as if it were a light 
weapon with the normal light weapon penalties. 
Perfect Balance (Ex) The penalties for fighting with two weapons are reduced by an additional –1 for you. 
This benefit stacks with improved balance. If you are using a one-handed weapon in your off hand, 
treating it as a light weapon, you use the normal light weapon penalties. 
Twin Blades (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls when making a full attack with two 
weapons or a double weapon (included above).
