SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Fleeting Glance (Sp) You can turn invisible for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. This 
ability functions as greater invisibility. These rounds need not be consecutive. 

Laughing Touch (Sp) You can cause a creature to burst out laughing for 1 round as a melee touch attack. A 
laughing creature can only take a move action but can defend itself normally. Once a creature has been 
affected by laughing touch, it is immune to its effects for 24 hours. You can use this ability a number of 
times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect. 
Weapon Familiarity You treat any weapon with the word “gnome” in its name as a martial weapon. 
Woodland Stride (Ex) You can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, 
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any 
other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede 
motion, however, still affect you.
