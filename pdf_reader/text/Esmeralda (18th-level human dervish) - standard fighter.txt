SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Armor Specialization (Ex) While wearing breastplate, you add 4 to the armor bonus. This increase to the 
armor bonus doesn’t increase the benefit that you gain from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are 
determined by your armor’s base armor bonus, including other advanced armor training options. 
Armor Training (Ex) When wearing armor, you reduce your armor check penalty by 4 (to a minimum of 0) 
and increase your armor’s maximum Dexterity modifier limit by 4. In addition, your speed is not 
reduced for wearing medium or heavy armor. 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +5 bonus on Will saves against fear effects (included above). 
Dazzling Intimidation (Ex) You apply your weapon training bonus to Intimidate checks and can attempt an 
Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent as a move action instead of a standard action. You can use 
your Dazzling Display feat as a standard action instead of a full-round action. 

Focused Weapon (Ex) Your damage with short swords is based on the damage of the warpriest’s sacred 
weapon class feature, treating your fighter level as your warpriest level. 
Trained Grace (Ex) When you use Weapon Finesse to make a melee attack with a weapon, using your 
Dexterity modifier on attack rolls and your Strength modifier on damage rolls, you double your weapon 
training bonus on damage rolls. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +4 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using light blades, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with light blades, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when 
defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against light blades. You receive a similar bonus 
with bows as well, but only at +3.
