SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage 
on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light 
armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Greed You gain a +2 racial bonus on Appraise skill checks made to determine the price of goods found in or 
under the water. 
Offensive Defense (Ex) When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack 
damage, the rogue gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC for each sneak attack die rolled for 1 round. 
Peg Leg You possess a peg leg, though you suffer none of the drawbacks for having it. You gain a +1 trait 
bonus on Fortitude saves as well as a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls against sharks and other animals 
with the aquatic subtype. 
Rope Master (Ex) You can move at your normal speed when using rope on a Climb check, can take 10 when 
using Acrobatics to move over narrow surfaces even when in danger or distracted, and gain a +4 bonus 
when determining the DC to escape bonds when you tie up a creature. 
Saltbeard You gain a +2 bonus on Profession (sailor) and Survival checks while at sea. You also gain a +1 
racial bonus on attack rolls and a +2 dodge bonus to AC against creatures with the aquatic or water 
subtype. 
Skeptic You gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against illusions. 
Storm Sailor (Ex) You treat all storms as if they were one category less severe for the purposes of sailing and 
navigation. (This benefit stacks with the Hurricane Savvy character trait and other effects related to wind 
conditions.) You can make an Acrobatics check to move your normal speed across uneven ground, and 
you do not take a penalty on any Acrobatics checks due to slightly slippery, slightly unsteady, or 
moderately unsteady conditions. 
Swinging Reposition (Ex) You can incorporate a ship’s masts, rigging, ropes, sails, and other such structures 
into your combat style. Provided you are wearing light armor, when fighting in an environment where 
such structures exist, you incorporate them into your Acrobatics checks by grabbing hold of the structure 
and swinging toward your opponent, making either a charge or a bull rush maneuver. Once you 
complete your attack or maneuver, you can reposition yourself. Immediately after making the charge or 
bull rush, you can move 5 feet as a free action, even if the charge ends your turn. This movement does 
not provoke attacks of opportunity. 
Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC even if you are caught flat-footed or struck by an 
invisible attacker. However, you still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. 
Unflinching (Ex) You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This bonus 
increases by +1 for every three rogue levels, to a maximum of +6 at 18th-level. 
Weapon Familiarity You are proficient with battleaxes, heavy picks, and warhammers, and treat any weapon 
with the word “dwarven” in its name as a martial weapon. 
 
PERSONAL BOOTY   
You generally keep the following additional items within your personal locker onboard ship: acid (3), assorted 
gems (worth 500gp), buckler, chain shirt, crossbow bolts (212), cutlass, daggers (4), leather armor, light 
crossbow, masterwork dagger, studded leather armor.
