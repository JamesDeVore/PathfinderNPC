SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Beast Totem (Su) While raging, you gain a +1 natural armor bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four 
barbarian levels you have obtained. 
Cat’s Luck (Ex) Once per day when you make a Reflex saving throw, you can roll the saving throw twice and 
take the better result. You must decide to use this ability before the saving throw is attempted. 
Extreme Endurance (Ex) You are inured to hot climate effects as if using endure elements. In addition, you 
gain 1 point of fire or cold resistance for every three barbarian levels beyond 3rd. 
Fast Sprinter (Ex) You gain a 10-foot racial bonus to your speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw 
actions. If you have the sprinter racial trait, your racial bonus to speed when using the charge, run, or 
withdraw action increases to a 20-foot bonus. 
Greater Beast Totem (Su) While raging, you gain the pounce special ability, allowing you to make a full 
attack at the end of a charge. In addition, the damage from your claws increases to 1d8 and the claws 
deal ×3 damage on a critical hit. 
Lesser Beast Totem (Su) While raging, you gain two claw attacks. These attacks are considered primary 
attacks and are made at your full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 
if Small) plus your Strength modifier (but see Greater Beast Totem). 
Poison Bloodroot—injury; save Fort DC 12, onset 1 round, frequency 1/round for 4 rounds, effect 1 Con and 1 
Wis and confusion for 1 round, cure 1 save. 
Rage (Ex) You can enter a rage as a free action for 24 rounds each day. The total number of rounds of rage per 
day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive. While in 
rage, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength, a +6 morale bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale 
bonus on Will saves. In addition, you take a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase to Constitution 
grants you 3 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like 
temporary hit points. While in rage, you cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based 
skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or 
concentration. You can end your rage as a free action and you become fatigued afterwards for a number 
of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the rage. You cannot enter a new rage while 
fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter rage multiple times during a single encounter or combat. 
Your rage does not end, even if you fall unconscious, provided you still have rounds of rage remaining. 
Sprint (Ex) Once per rage, you can use a single full-round run action to move up to 6 times your speed or a 
single full-round charge action to move up to 3 times your speed. 
Sprinter You gain a 10-foot racial bonus to your speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions (but 
see Fast Sprinter). 
Swift Foot (Ex) You gain a 10-foot enhancement bonus to your speed while raging.
