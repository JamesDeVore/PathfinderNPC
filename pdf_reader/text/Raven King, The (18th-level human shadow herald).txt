SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Acidic Ray (Sp) You can fire an acidic ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged 
touch attack. The acidic ray deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two effective sorcerer levels 
you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. 

Alien Resistance (Su) You gain spell resistance equal to your effective sorcerer level + 10. 
Armor Training (Ex) Whenever you are wearing armor, you reduce the armor check penalty by 3 (to a 
minimum of 0) and increase the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by your armor by 3. In addition, you 
can also move at your normal speed while wearing medium or heavy armor. 
Darkvision (Ex) You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range 
increases by 30 feet. 
Defensive Roll (Ex) You can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than you otherwise 
would. Once per day, when you would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a 
weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), you can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this 
ability, you must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, you take 
only half damage from the blow; if it fails, you take full damage. You must be aware of the attack and 
able to react to it in order to execute your defensive roll—if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC, 
you can’t use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save 
for half damage, your evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll. 
Good Fortune You may reroll one roll you just made, before the results are revealed, once per day. You lose 
this ability if you are ever parted from your luck blade. 
Hide in Plain Sight (Su) You can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as you are within 10 
feet of an area of dim light, you can hide yourself from view in the open without anything to actually 
hide behind. You cannot, however, hide in your own shadow. 
Improved Evasion (Ex) You take no damage at all on successful saving throws against attacks that allow a 
Reflex saving throw for half damage. What’s more, you take only half damage even if you fail your 
saving throw. 
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex) You cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. You still 
lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. You can still lose your Dexterity bonus to AC if an 
opponent successfully uses the feint action against you, however. Additionally, you can no longer be 
flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack you by flanking you, unless the attacker 
has at least four more rogue levels than you have levels in classes with uncanny dodge. 
Shadow Call (Sp) You can create creatures and effects out of raw shadow. This ability functions as greater 
shadow conjuration, using your shadowdancer level as the caster level. You can use this ability four 
times per day. The DC for this ability is Charisma-based. 
Shadow Illusion (Sp) You can create visual illusions. This ability functions as silent image, using your 
shadowdancer level as the caster level. You can use this ability five times per day. The DC for this 
ability is Charisma-based. 
Shadow Jump (Su) You gain the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a dimension door spell. 
The limitation is that the magical transport must begin and end in an area with at least some dim light. 
You can jump up to a total of 320 feet each day in this way. This amount can be split among many 
jumps, but each one, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot 
increment. 
Shadow Master (Su) Whenever you are in an area of dim light, you gain 
DR 10/– and a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws. In addition, 
whenever you successfully score a critical hit against a foe who is in 
an area of dim light, that foe is blinded for 1d6 rounds. 
Shadow Power (Sp) You can use raw shadow to damage your foes. This 
ability functions as shadow evocation, using your shadowdancer 
level as the caster level. You can use this ability twice per day. The 
DC for this ability is Charisma-based. 
Shield Other Due to your ring of friend shield, you are constantly under the 
effect of shield other. Therefore, any time you would suffer hit point 
damage, you only take half the normal amount. The ring’s mate is in 
the possession of Lady Arroway (see below), and it is she who takes 
the remaining half of your hit point damage. 

Slippery Mind (Ex) This ability represents your ability to 
wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or 
compel you. If you are affected by an enchantment spell or effect 
and fail your saving throw, you can attempt it again 1 round later 
at the same DC. You get only this one extra chance to succeed on 
your saving throw. 
Summon Shadow (Su) You can summon a shadow, an undead 
shade. Unlike a normal shadow, this shadow’s alignment 
matches yours, and the creature cannot create spawn. The 
summoned shadow receives a +4 bonus on Will saves made to 
halve the damage from positive channeled energy and the shadow cannot be turned or commanded. This 
shadow serves as a companion to you and can communicate intelligibly with you. This shadow has a 
number of hit points equal to half your total. The shadow uses your base attack bonus and base save 
bonuses. If a shadow companion is destroyed, or you choose to dismiss it, you must attempt a DC 15 
Fortitude save. If the saving throw fails, you gain one permanent negative level. A successful saving 
throw avoids this negative level. A destroyed or dismissed shadow companion cannot be replaced for 30 
days. 
Unusual Anatomy (Ex) You have a 50% chance to ignore any critical hit or sneak attack scored against you. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using light blades, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with light blades, and to your 
Combat Maneuver Defense when defending against disarm and 
sunder attempts made against light blades.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Aura of Good (Ex) You have a particularly powerful aura corresponding to your deity’s alignment (see the 
detect evil spell for details). 
Breadth of Knowledge You gain a bonus on Knowledge skill checks equal to half your class level (minimum 
+1, included above) and can make Knowledge skill checks untrained. 
Channel Energy (Su) You can release waves of positive energy by channeling the power of your faith through 
your holy symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy 
channeled and the creatures targeted. Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all living in a 30-foot 
radius centered on you. The amount of healing is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of 
damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1
st. Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their 
maximum hit point total—all excess healing is lost. You may channel energy a number of times per day 
equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of 
opportunity. You can choose whether or not to include yourself in this effect. You must be able to 
present her holy symbol to use this ability. 
Combat Medic (Ex) You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when using the Heal skill to stabilize another 
creature or when casting healing spells. 
Healer’s Blessing (Su) All of your cure spells are treated as if they were empowered, increasing the amount of 
damage healed by half (+50%). This does not apply to damage dealt to undead with a cure spell. This 
does not stack with the Empower Spell metamagic feat. 
Merciful Healing (Su) You can channel positive energy to relieve one or more harmful conditions. When you 
channel energy you can remove the exhausted, fatigued, nauseated or sickened conditions from up to 
three living creatures that you heal within your channel energy burst. Feats and effects that affect a 
paladin’s mercy also affect this ability. 
Restorative Touch (Su) You can touch a creature, letting the healing power of your deity flow through you to 
relieve the creature of a minor condition. Your touch can remove the dazed, fatigued, shaken, sickened, 

or staggered condition. You choose which condition is removed. You can use this ability a number of 
times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. 
Shadow Blending (Su) Attacks against you in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of the normal 20% 
miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment; it just increases the miss chance. 
True Healer (Su) When you channel holy energy, you can choose to apply the benefits of merciful healing or 
to reroll any 1s when determining how much damage you heal with the holy energy. You must choose 
which benefit to take before you roll to see how much damage you heal. 
Verbal Instruction (Ex) You can use the aid another action to assist an ally within 30 feet on a skill or ability 
check. The ally must be able to hear and understand your instructions. For every three cleric levels 
beyond 3rd, you can instruct one additional ally. If all allies are not engaged in the same task, using this 
ability is a full-round action rather than a standard action. 
Well-Read (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus on skill checks, caster level checks, 
and saving throws if such rolls pertain to mundane or magical 
glyphs, runes, scrolls, symbols, and other writings (not included 
above).

Other Minions: Your other followers generally stay within your kingdom and handle your personal affairs 
while you are away, leaving your homeland only when called upon. They primarily consist of fetchling 
rogues and clerics (often trained in the arts of fleshwarping) as well as other darkfolk. However, you are 
often accompanied by two battle mage and two battle monk bodyguards (as presented in the NPC 
Gallery in the GameMastery Guide).
