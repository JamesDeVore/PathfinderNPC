Gregarious (Ex) Whenever you successfully use Diplomacy to win over an individual, that creature takes a –2 
penalty to resist any of your Charisma-based skill checks for the next 24 hours. 
Kitsune Magic (Ex/Sp) You add +1 to the DC of any saving throws against enchantment spells that you cast. 
You also gain an additional +2 bonus to the DC due to your favored class bonuses. 
Woodland Stride (Ex) You can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, 
overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any 
other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede 
motion, however, still affect you (though not even those can stop you with your ring of sacred 
mistletoe).

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Starlight Blast (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a lyrakien can tap into the divine power of 
Elysium, unleashing a blast of holy starlight in a 5-foot burst. All creatures in this area take 1d4 points 
of holy damage, plus 1 point for each step their alignment deviates from chaotic good. For example, a 
chaotic neutral or neutral good creature would take 1d4+1 points of damage, a neutral creature would 
take 1d4+2 points of damage, and a lawful evil creature would take 1d4+4 points of damage. A DC 12 
Reflex save negates this damage. Chaotic good creatures are unaffected by this ability. The save DC is 
Constitution-based. 
Traveler’s Friend (Su) The performances and company of a lyrakien ease the burden of travel. Once per day, a 
creature may spend a minute listening to a lyrakien’s performance—doing so removes the effects of 
exhaustion and fatigue from the listener.
