SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Befuddling Strike (Ex) When you deal sneak attack damage against an opponent, that opponent takes a –2 
penalty on attack rolls against you for 1d4 rounds. This ability cannot be used in conjunction with 
bleeding attack. 
Bleeding Attack (Ex) You can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack 
causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of your sneak attack. 
Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The 
bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point 
damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any 
damage reduction the creature might possess. This ability cannot be used in conjunction with befuddling 
strike. 
Brutal Beating (Ex) Whenever you deal sneak attack damage, you can choose to forgo 1d6 points of sneak 
attack damage to make the target sickened for a number of rounds equal to ½ your rogue level. This 
ability does not stack with itself—only the most recent duration applies. 

Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage 
on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light 
armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Frightening (Ex) Whenever you successfully use Intimidate to demoralize a creature, the duration of the 
shaken condition is increased by 1 round. In addition, if the target is shaken for 4 or more rounds, you 
can instead decide to make the target frightened for 1 round. 
Offensive Defense (Ex) When you hit a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, you gain a 
+1 dodge bonus to AC for each sneak attack die rolled for 1 round. 
Scout’s Charge (Ex) Whenever you make a charge, your attack deals sneak attack damage as if the target were 
flat-footed. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. 
Skirmisher (Ex) Whenever you move more than 10 feet in a round and make an attack action, the attack deals 
sneak attack damage as if the target was flat-footed. If you make more than one attack this turn, this 
ability only applies to the first attack. Foes with uncanny dodge are immune to this ability. 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals 5d6 extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to 
AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flank your target. Should you 
score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as 
sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, 
whip, or an unarmed strike), you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal 
damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, 
not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital 
spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with 
concealment.
