SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Arcane Bond (Su) If you attempt to cast a spell without your bonded shield worn or in hand, you must make a 
concentration check or lose the spell. The DC for this check is equal to 20 + the spell’s level. A bonded 
shield can be used once per day to cast any one spell that you have in your spellbook and are capable of 
casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by you, including 

casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on your caster level. This spell cannot be modified by 
metamagic feats or other abilities. The magic properties of your bonded shield, including any magic 
abilities added to the object, only function for you. 
Arcane Pool (Su) You have a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that you can draw upon to fuel your powers 
and enhance your weapon or shield (which must be fueled independently of one another). This arcane 
pool has a number of points equal to ½ your magus level (minimum 1) + your Intelligence modifier. The 
pool refreshes once each day when you prepare your spells. You can expend 1 point from your arcane 
pool as a swift action to grant any weapon or shield you are holding a +2 enhancement bonus for 1 
minute. These bonuses can be added to the weapon or shield, stacking with existing enhancement to a 
maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves. These bonuses can be used 
to add any of the following weapon or shield properties: animated, arrow catching, arrow deflection, 
bashing, blinding, dancing, flaming, flaming burst, fortification (any), frost, icy burst, keen, reflecting, 
shock, shocking burst, speed, spell resistance (any), or vorpal. Adding these properties consumes an 
amount of bonus equal to the property’s cost. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, 
but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be 
added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the 
arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time you use this ability. These bonuses 
do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than you. You can only enhance one weapon 
in this way at one time. If you use this ability again, the first use immediately ends. 
Concentrate (Ex) You can reroll any concentration check you have just made with a +4 bonus. You must use 
this ability after the roll is made, but before the roll’s outcome is determined. You must take the second 
roll, even if it is worse. You can use this ability once per day. 
Diminished Spellcasting A skirnir casts one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number 
to 0, you may cast spells of that level only if your Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level. 
Enduring Blade (Su) Whenever you enchant your weapon or shield using your arcane pool, you may spend 1 
additional point from your arcane pool to increase the duration to 1 minute per magus level. 
Medium Armor (Ex) You can cast magus spells while wearing light or medium armor without incurring the 
normal arcane spell failure chance. Like any other arcane spellcaster, when using a shield or wearing 
heavy armor you incur a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. 
Phalanx Fighting (Ex) When you wield a shield, you can use any polearm or spear of your size as a one-
handed weapon. 
Shield Pool (Ex) As a free action, you may spend 1 point from your arcane pool to add your shield bonus to AC 
(not including enhancement bonuses) on a concentration check to cast defensively. You may also use a 
touch attack or shield bash with your shield in conjunction with any pool strike magus arcana. 
Shielded Spell Combat (Su) You learn to cast spells and wield your weapons at the same time. This functions 
much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, 
you must have one hand holding a shield, while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the 
other hand. As a full-round action, you can make all of your attacks with your melee weapon at a –2 
penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action (any 
attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty). If you cast this spell defensively, you can 
decide to take an additional penalty on your attack rolls, up to your Intelligence bonus, and add the same 
amount as a circumstance bonus on your concentration check. If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but 
the attacks still take the penalty. You can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, 
but if you have more than one attack, you cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks. You may use 
your shield hand to perform somatic components for magus spells, forfeiting the shield’s bonus to AC 
until the beginning of your next turn; if the bonded shield is a buckler, you retain its bonus to AC. 
Sorcerous Shield (Ex) You are proficient with all types of shields, including tower shields, and do not suffer an 
arcane spell failure chance when casting magus spells while using a shield. You treat your magus levels 
as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for shield-related feats. 
Spellshield (Su) As a standard action, you may store a magus spell in your shield by spending 1 point from 
your arcane pool per level of the spell. This functions as the spell storing weapon special ability, but 
activates only on a successful shield bash by you and is not limited to spells of 3rd level or less. 

Spellstrike (Su) Whenever you cast a spell with a range of “touch” from the magus spell list, you can deliver 
the spell through any weapon you are wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch 
attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, you can make one free melee attack with your weapon (at 
your highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its 
normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If you make this attack in concert with spell combat, 
this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the 
weapon’s critical range (20, 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar 
effects), but the spell effect only deals ×2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage 
uses its own critical modifier. 
Stand Firm (Ex) You gain a +1 bonus to CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts. This bonus also 
applies on saves against trample attacks.
