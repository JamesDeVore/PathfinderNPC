SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Fleet-Footed You receive Run as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks. 
Light Sensitivity (Ex) You are dazzled in areas of bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell. 
Silent Hunter You reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving by 5 and can make Stealth checks while 
running at a –20 penalty (this number includes the penalty reduction from this racial trait). 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC 
(whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flanks your target. This extra 
damage is 1d6 at 1
st-level, and increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should you score a 
critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak 
attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, 
or an unarmed strike), you can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal 
damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, 
not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital 
spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with 
concealment. 
Studied Target (Ex) You can study an opponent you can see as a move action. You then gain a +1 bonus on 
Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against that opponent, and 
a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of slayer class abilities against that 
opponent increase by 1. You can only maintain these bonuses against one opponent at a time; these 
bonuses remain in effect until either the opponent is dead or you study a new target. If you deal sneak 
attack damage to a target, you can study that target as an immediate action, allowing you to apply your 
studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon damage roll). 
Track (Ex) You add half your slayer level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.
