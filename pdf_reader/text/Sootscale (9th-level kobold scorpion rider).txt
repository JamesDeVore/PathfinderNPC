SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Aid Allies (Ex) Whenever you use the aid another action to assist one of your allies, the ally receives a +4 
bonus to his Armor Class, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. 
Banner (Ex) Your banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to your allies and companions. As long as your 
banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear 
and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. The banner must be at least Small or 
larger and must be carried or displayed by you or your mount to function. 
Cavalier’s Charge (Ex) You learn to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. You receive a +4 
bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, you do 
not suffer any penalty to your AC after making a charge attack while mounted. 
Challenge (Ex) Twice per day, you can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, you choose one target 
within sight to challenge. Your melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against 
the target of your challenge. This extra damage is equal to your cavalier level. Challenging a foe 
requires much of your concentration. You take a –2 penalty to your Armor Class, except against attacks 
made by the target of your challenge. The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or 
unconscious or until the combat ends. In addition, whenever you issue a challenge, your allies receive a 
+3 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls against the target of your challenge whenever you are 
threatening the target. 

Strategy (Ex) You can spend a standard action to grant one of a number of bonuses to all allies within 30 feet 
(including yourself). The allies must be able to see or hear you to receive this bonus. You can grant a +2 
dodge bonus to AC for 1 round, a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls for 1 round, or the ability to move 
up to their speed as an immediate action once. The cavalier can grant a different bonus to each ally 
within range, but allies can only benefit from this ability once per combat. 
Tactician (Ex) Twice per day as a standard action, you can grant one of your teamwork class bonus feats to all 
allies within 30 feet who can see and hear you. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 
round for every two cavalier levels you possess. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these 
bonus feats.
