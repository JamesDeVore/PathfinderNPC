SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Artificer’s Touch (Sp) You can cast mending at will, using your cleric level as the caster level to repair 
damaged objects. In addition, you can cause damage to objects and construct creatures by striking them 
with a melee touch attack. Objects and constructs take 1d6 points of damage +1 for every two cleric 
levels you possess. This attack bypasses an amount of damage reduction and hardness equal to your 
cleric level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. 
Calming Touch (Sp) You can touch a creature as a standard action to heal it of 1d6 points of nonlethal damage 
+ 1 point per cleric level. This touch also removes the fatigued, shaken, and sickened conditions (but has 
no effect on more severe conditions). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 
your Wisdom modifier. 
Channel Energy (Su) You may release a burst of positive energy in a 30-ft. radius burst as a standard action. 
When doing so you can choose to harm undead creatures in the area (3d6 damage, Will DC 16 half) or 

to heal living creatures in the area (3d6 healing). You can use this ability a number of times per day 
equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.
