SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Diviner’s Fortune (Sp) When you activate this school power, you can touch any creature as a standard action 
to give it an insight bonus on all of its attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws equal 
to ½ your wizard level (minimum +1) for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day 
equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. 
Forewarned (Su) You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a Perception roll to notice a 
foe, but you are still considered flat-footed until you take an action. In addition, you receive a bonus on 
initiative checks equal to ½ your wizard level. 
Ongoing Spells You have cast the contingency spell upon yourself. Should you ever be made helpless against 
your will (such as when knocked unconscious, paralyzed, petrified, securely bound, or forcefully put to 
sleep), you are immediately teleported (as per the teleport spell) to the nearest known temple dedicated 
to your deity. Your person carries upon it a note with detailed instructions for the temple’s priests should 
you not be in a position to direct them to your aid personally. Additionally, you have used the 
permanency spell to make the following spell effects permanent in regards to yourself: arcane sight, 
comprehend languages, darkvision, see invisibility, and tongues. The following spells are also regularly 
active upon your person: endure elements, false life, mage armor, mind blank, moment of prescience, 
overland flight, and protection from arrows. Additionally, should all your magical contingencies and 
protections fail, you have a clone body waiting in a secret laboratory to be resurrected. All ongoing spell 
effects function at 15
th-caster level (and thus require a DC 26 caster level check to dispel) and their 
effects are included in the above stats where appropriate. 
Scrying Adept (Su) You are always aware when you are being observed via magic, as if you had a permanent 
detect scrying. In addition, whenever you scry on a subject, treat the subject as one step more familiar to 
you. Very familiar subjects get a –10 penalty on their save to avoid your scrying attempts. 
Weapon Familiarity Elves are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, 
and shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word “elven” in its name 
as a martial weapon.

All rings of memory are powerful, sentient, magical rings that have been created by being infused with a portion 
of a sentient creature’s departed spirit (very much like a soulbound doll). They possess the personality of the 
deceased, and also demonstrate random memories of the subject as well. Because their powers and abilities are 
based on a once living individual, rings of memory are always unique from one another. However, they all share 
the above-mentioned traits and are always worth at least 75,000gp in magical abilities. An example ring of 
memory is shown below: 
 
Arian was Corral’s husband and a great linguist and sage of the natural world responsible for building up much 
of the Elven forest kingdom.  While traveling abroad he was murdered by orc marauders. So distraught was 
Corral when she divined her lover’s death, she sought out and single-handedly annihilated the orcs responsible, 
followed shortly thereafter by the remainder of their entire tribal horde. She then tracked down her husband’s 

remains and gave him a proper burial. Via a lengthy magical ritual, she then linked her most precious 
possession—her wedding band—to his departed soul. Though only a shadow of his memory, the newly sentient 
ring of telekinesis has since become both a powerful ally and a comforting reminder of happier times long gone. 
 
Arian, the ring, is incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable of the natural world, though it contains only a 
fraction of the knowledge the living Arian once had. Like the living Arian, it is extremely fond and protective of 
Corral. It also strives to protect elves and the natural world in general. Because of its memories, Arian 
sometimes confuses itself for Corral’s once living husband.
