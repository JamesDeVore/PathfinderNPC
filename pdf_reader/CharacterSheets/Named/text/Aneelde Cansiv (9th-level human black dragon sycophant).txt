SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline’s 
energy type (fire), that spell deals +1 point of damage per die rolled. 
Breath Weapon (Su) You gain a breath weapon useable once per day. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of 
damage of your energy type per dragon disciple or sorcerer level to all targets in a 30-ft. cone. Those 
caught in the area of the breath receive a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 
+ ½ your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. 

Claws (Ex) You can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to 
make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. Each of these attacks 
deals 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. You can use your claws for a number of rounds 
per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. 
Detect Good (Sp) At will, you can use detect good, as the spell. You can, as a move action, concentrate on a 
single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is good, learning the strength of its aura as if 
having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, you do not detect good in any 
other object or individual within range. 
Dragon Bite (Ex) Whenever you use your bloodline to grow claws, you also gain a bite attack. This natural 
attack is made at your full base attack bonus. You add 1½ times your Strength modifier on damage rolls 
made with your bite. 
Dragon Resistances (Ex) You gain resist 5 against your energy type (acid) and a +1 natural armor bonus 
(included above). 
Smite Good (Su) Once per day, as a swift action, you can choose one target within sight to smite. If this target 
is good, you add your Charisma bonus to your attack rolls and add your anti-paladin level to all damage 
rolls made against the target of your smite. If the target of smite good is an outsider with the good 
subtype, a good-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful 
attack increases to 2 points of damage per anti-paladin level you possess. Regardless of the target, smite 
good attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite good is in 
effect, you gain a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to your AC against attacks made by 
the target of the smite. If you target a creature that is not good, your smite is wasted with no effect. The 
smite good effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the anti-paladin rests and 
regains her uses of this ability. 
Touch of Corruption (Su) You surround your hand with a fiendish flame, causing terrible wounds to open on 
those you touch. Each day you can use this ability a number of times equal to ½ your antipaladin level + 
your Charisma modifier. As a touch attack, you can cause 1d6 points of damage for every two 
antipaladin levels you possess. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of 
opportunity. 
Unholy Resilience (Su) You gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on all saving throws (included above).
