SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Evasive Archer (Ex) You gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against ranged attacks (not included). 
Hawkeye (Ex) You gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks (included above), and the range increment for any 
bow you use increases by 20 feet. 
Trick Shot (Ex) You can perform disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip combat maneuvers with a bow against any 
target within 30 feet, with a –4 penalty to your CMB. These maneuvers use up arrows as normal. A 
target grappled by an arrow can break free by destroying your arrow (hardness 5, hit points 1, break DC 
13) or with an Escape Artist or CMB check (against your CMD –4). 
Expert Archer (Ex) You receive a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using bows (included above). 
Safe Shot (Ex) You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with a bow. 

 
SPECIALIZED ARROWS 
Adamantine Arrows: These arrows are made of adamantine, bypass DR/adamantine, and ignore hardness 20 
or less. 
Alchemical Silver Arrows: An alchemical silver arrow is the bane of lycanthropes and devils alike. It bypasses 
DR/silver, but deals 1 less damage. 
Bleeding Arrows: A bleeding arrow deals normal damage when it hits a creature. Each round thereafter, the 
creature bleeds for 1 point of damage until the bleeding is stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the 
application of a cure spell or some other healing magic. A critical hit does not multiply the bleed 
damage. Creatures immune to critical hits (such as plants and constructs) are immune to the bleed 
damage dealt by this weapon. 
Blunt Arrows: These arrows have rounded wooden tips. They deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing 
damage. An archer can use a blunt arrow to deal nonlethal damage (at the normal –4 attack penalty for 
using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage). 
Cold Iron Arrows: Arrows made of cold iron are the bane of many fey and demons alike. They bypass 
DR/cold iron. 
Durable Arrows: Durable arrows don’t break due to normal use, whether or not they hit their target; unless the 
arrow goes missing, an archer can retrieve and reuse a durable arrow again and again. Durable arrows 
can be broken in other ways (such as deliberate snapping, hitting a fire elemental, and so on). If crafted 
with magic (such as bane), the magic only lasts for one use of the arrow, but the non-magical arrow can 
still be reused or imbued with magic again. 
Dye Arrows: Firing a dye arrow is a ranged touch attack; a creature struck by a dye arrow takes no damage but 
is splashed with black, blue, green, or red marker dye (see Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting 213) 
sufficient to coat about 1 square foot. 
Flight Arrows: These arrows have light shafts and special fletching to give them greater range. A flight arrow’s 
range increment is 20 feet greater with longbows, 10 feet greater with shortbows. They deal damage as 
if one size category smaller. 
Lodestone Arrows: You gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls when firing a lodestone arrow at a target wearing a 
significant amount of metal armor (at least chain mail or a metal shield) or made of metal. The increased 
magnetism fades 1 round after you activate it (a move action), after which time it is a normal arrow. In 
areas with a lot of magnetic metal, the attack bonus may drop to 0 or even become a penalty as 
competing sources steer the arrow away from your intended target. The magnetized arrow only deals 
half damage. 
Pheromone Arrows: Any creature with the scent ability gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls made 
against a target marked with a pheromone arrow. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until the target spends 1 
minute washing. It otherwise functions like a normal arrow in terms of damage, range, and so on. 
Raining Arrows: The reservoir of holy water is designed to burst on impact, hitting the target and splashing 
nearby creatures as if you had thrown the vial. A raining arrow has a –2 penalty on attack rolls due to its 
weight. 
Smoke Arrows: This arrow is actually a specially-shaped smokestick that can be fired from a bow. It trails 
smoke as it flies, and creates a 5-foot cube of smoke where it strikes. It otherwise functions like a 
normal arrow in terms of damage, range, and so on. 
Splintercloud Arrows: When fired, the numerous bone fragments tear themselves apart, forming a 5-foot burst 
of razor-sharp bones that deals 1d3 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 18 negates). 
Tangleshot Arrows: You fire a tangleshot arrow as a ranged touch attack; the arrow deals no damage when it 
hits, but the target is splashed with the alchemical adhesive. The reduced amount of the glue means this 
arrow is less effective than an actual tanglefoot bag (DC 10 Reflex save, DC 12 Strength check to break, 
10 points of slashing damage to cut through, DC 10 Concentration check). The weight of a tangleshot 
arrow reduces the bow’s range increment to half normal. 
Trip Arrows: If the arrow hits, it makes a trip attack against the target with a CMB of +5; the target falls prone 
if it the check succeeds, but if it fails the target cannot attempt to trip you in return. 

Whistling Arrows: These arrows come with specially designed grooves and fletching that cause them to emit a 
loud keening sound audible within 500 feet of their flight path.
