Baby Hecatoncheires 
“You are a mere mortal. It is your very nature to die.” 
 
This large abomination stands nearly 12 feet tall and, like a 
living tree bulging with knobby boles, has dozens of arms and 
nearly as many heads. Words fail to describe the monstrosity of 
its form, or the brutality of its many visages. Every hand appears 
to be armed with a weapon, either a fine sword or a small 
boulder. Its girth is so massive, that it can only ever bring a 
fraction of its weapons to bear at any given time. The monstrous 
eidolon wears magic half plate which, due to its amorphous 
nature, might well be part of the very creature itself. 
 
Before it was even fully formed, this terrifying creature was 
wrenched from the realm of the Proteans by a young summoner 
who would bind it into service. Impressed with the monster he 
had cowed, the summoner swore to “raise” the young abomination until it became as strong as the legendary 
“hundred handed ones,” ancient beings which were known for slaying entire deific pantheons in legends of old. 
Only then would the insane summoner grant the abomination its freedom, unleashing doom upon the world. 
 
In order to be played, Baby Hecaton requires an 11
th-level summoner with at least 15 Evolution Points).

Link You and your eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as 
you are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing you to give orders to your 
eidolon at any time. What’s more, magic items interfere with this link, so that you and your eidolon 
must share magic item slots. When both you and the eidolon are wearing a magic item in the same slot, 
your magic item continues to function while the eidolon’s becomes dormant. An eidolon must still have 
the appropriate magical item slot in order to be able to use of a given magic item. 
Share Spells (Ex) You may cast a spell with a target of “You” on your eidolon (as a spell with a range of 
touch) instead of on yourself. You may cast spells on your eidolon even if the spells normally do not 
affect creatures of the eidolon’s type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner 
spell list. This ability does not allow your eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they 
function like spells.
