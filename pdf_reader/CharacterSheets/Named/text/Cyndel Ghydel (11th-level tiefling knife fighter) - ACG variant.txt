SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Fiendish Sprinter You gain a 10-foot racial bonus to your speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw 
actions. 
Maw You possess a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. It is a primary natural attack. 
Prehensile Tail You possess a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry items. While you cannot wield 
weapons with your tail, you can use it to retrieve small, stowed objects carried on your person as a swift 
action. 
Scaled Skin You gain fire resistance 5 and a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. 
Snap Shot (Ex) You may treat your initiative roll as a 20 for a surprise round, regardless of your initiative, but 
you may only take an attack action with a ranged weapon. Your normal initiative roll is used in 
subsequent rounds. If two or more characters possess this talent, their initiative determines the order in 

which they act, but they all go before any other creature. If you are prevented from acting in the surprise 
round, this talent has no effect. 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals 3d6 extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to 
AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flank your target. This bonus 
damage is considered precision damage. Should you score a critical hit with precision damage is not 
multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon 
that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), you can make a sneak attack that 
deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to 
deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be able to see the 
target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak 
attack while striking a creature with concealment. 
Stalker (Ex) You gain your studied target bonus on Disguise, Intimidate, and Stealth checks against your 
studied opponent. 
Studied Target (Ex) You can study up to three opponents you can see as a move or swift action. You then gain 
a +3 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against 
those opponents, and a +3 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against it. The DCs of your slayer 
class abilities against those opponents increase by 3. You can only maintain these bonuses against three 
opponents at a time; these bonuses remain in effect until either the opponents are dead or you study new 
targets. If you deal sneak attack damage to a target, you can study that target as an immediate action, 
allowing you to apply your studied target bonuses against that target (including to the normal weapon 
damage roll). You may discard this connection to a studied target as a free action, allowing you to study 
another target in its place. 
Swift Tracker (Ex) You can move at your normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking 
the normal –5 penalty. When moving at up to twice your normal speed while tracking, you take only a 
–10 penalty instead of the normal –20. 
Track (Ex) You add ½ your slayer level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks. 
Unwitting Ally (Ex) You can spend a swift action to attempt to make an opponent act like an ally for the 
purposes of providing a flank until the beginning of your next turn. The opponent must be able to hear 
and see you, and you must succeed at a Bluff check opposed by the opponent’s Sense Motive. If the 
check succeeds, the opponent acts as an ally for the purpose of providing a flank. Whether or not the 
check succeeds, you cannot use this trick again on the same opponent for the next 24 hours. If you fail 
the check by 5 or more, you cannot use the unwitting ally ability on any opponent within line of sight of 
the failed attempt for 24 hours.
