Encumbrance light 33 lb., medium 66 lb., heavy 100 lb.; Weight Carried 60 lb. (excluding tender) 
SPECIAL ABILITIES 
False Death (Su) Add charm person and dominate person to your spell list. You must select these spells using 
your allotment of spells known. Any creature under the effect of one of these spells or charm monster 
appears dead to any examiners. Although affected creatures do not detect as undead, they look pale and 
death-like while under the effects of your magic. Additionally, an affected creature ordered to lie still 
gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise skill checks to look like a corpse. 
Natural Divination (Ex) You can read the entrails of a freshly killed animal or humanoid to gain an insight 
bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on one saving throw. Alternatively, by observing and 
interpreting the flight of birds, you may apply a +10 competence bonus on any one skill check. Finally, 
by charting marks in dirt or on stone, or observing the behavior of sand thrown into the wind, you gain a 
+4 insight bonus on one initiative check. These bonuses must be used during the next 24 hours, and you 
must declare you are using the bonus before the check or save is made. Making a natural divination 
takes 10 minutes. You may use natural divination (in any combination) once per day plus one additional 
time per day for every four oracle levels you have attained. 
Ongoing Spells The following spells are regularly active upon your person: aura of doom, death ward (from 
darkskull), deathwatch, freedom of movement, protection from good (from darkskull), shield other (with 
cyclops), status (on cyclops, purple worm, and rocs), and tongues. Unless otherwise stated, all spells 
benefit from the Extend Spell feat. All ongoing spell effects function at 16th-caster level (and thus 
require a DC 26 caster level check to dispel) except for aura of doom and deathwatch, which function at 
17th-caster level (DC 27). These spell effects are included in the above and below stats where 
appropriate. 
Reminder of Death (Su) You can imbue a handful of salt with the power of life, making it a potent ward 
against undead creatures. As a standard action, you can throw salt at a single undead creature within 5 
feet, affecting it as per the spell halt undead. Alternatively, you can spend a full-round action covering a 
5-foot-square with imbued salt, causing any single undead creature that enters this square within the next 
10 minutes to be affected as per halt undead. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 
3 + your Charisma modifier. The save DC is Charisma-based. 
Spirit Vessels (Su) You can channel wendo spirits into lifeless bodies, reanimating them to aid you. When 
using the animate dead spell, you can control 6 HD worth of undead creatures per caster level rather 
than 4 HD. In addition, any zombies or juju zombies you create using animate dead, create undead, or 
similar spells possess maximum hit points. 
Undead Servitude (Su) You gain Command Undead as a bonus feat. You can channel negative energy a 
number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier, but only to use Command Undead. You 
can take other feats to add to this ability, such as Improved Channel, but not feats that alter this ability, 
such as Alignment Channel.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Deathless (Su) A bloody skeleton is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it reanimates 1 hour later at 1 
hit point, allowing its fast healing thereafter to resume healing it. A bloody skeleton can be permanently 
destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or 
hallow spell, or if its remains are sprinkled with a vial of holy water. 
 
Araonna’s giants serve as her shock troops and body guards. Wherever she goes, they go (though they are often 
kept beneath the surface of the earth, awaiting their master’s call).

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Death Burst (Ex) When a plague zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of decay. All creatures adjacent to the 
plague zombie are exposed to its plague as if struck by a slam attack and must make a Fortitude save or 
contract zombie rot. 
Disease (Su) The slam attack—as well as any other natural attacks—of a plague zombie carries the zombie rot 
disease. Zombie rot: slam; save Fort DC = 10 + ½ the zombie’s Hit Dice + the zombie’s Cha modifier; 
onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is 
infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 
hours. 
Quick Strikes (Ex) Whenever a fast zombie takes a full-attack action, it can make one additional slam attack at 
its highest base attack bonus (included above). 
 
Araonna and her undead hoard often ride within her crimson worm while it burrows beneath the earth, allowing 
her to keep her undead hoard out of sight of those who might attempt to destroy them (or worse, wrest control 
from her). Once battle is joined, the worm emerges, releasing the hoard upon her enemies before submerging 
again and creating sink holes underneath large groups of enemies, burying them alive (to later be dug up and 
animated by Araonna). It is rumored that Araonna once destroyed an entire city by having her worm weaken its 
foundations for weeks, ultimately causing the entire city to collapse in on itself in one massive sink hole.

SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Flash of Insight (Su) Once per day as an immediate action, a cyclops can peer into an occluded visual spectrum 
of possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to select the exact result of one die roll before the roll is 
made. This effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops only, and cannot be applied to the rolls of 
others. 
 
In return for immortality, Cid now willingly serves as Araonna Chorster’s lieutenant (though she sometimes 
reinforces her dominance with Command Undead), commanding her undead minions in her absence. He also 
serves as her soothsayer, offering her wisdom when called upon. He is a cautious warrior and military tactician 
who prefers to think things through before resorting to violence. He has long been one of Araonna’s implacable 
allies and friends.

Araonna and Cid often use their rocs (formerly a mated pair) as steeds when aerial reconnaissance or assault is 
called for. Like her serpent, they are often kept in a temporary pocket plane until needed. 
 
Other Undead Minions: At any given moment, Araonna keeps no less than 150 undead soldiers (human fast 
plague zombies with 22 HP). These soldiers are uncontrolled and are often simply released into an area to create 
havoc among her enemies. For the safety of herself and others, she keeps these soldiers trapped within a pocket 
plane of her own design, allowing her to release them all anywhere in her vicinity simply by dispelling the 
plane.
