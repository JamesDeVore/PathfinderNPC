SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Bloodline Arcana Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline’s 
energy type (fire), that spell deals +1 point of damage per die rolled. 
Breath Weapon (Su) You gain a breath weapon useable once per day. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of 
damage of your energy type per dragon disciple or sorcerer level to all targets in a 30-ft. cone. Those 
caught in the area of the breath receive a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 
+ ½ your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. 

Claws (Ex) You can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to 
make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. Each of these attacks 
deals 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier. You can use your claws for a number of rounds 
per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. 
Detect Evil (Sp) At will, you can use detect evil, as the spell. You can, as a move action, concentrate on a 
single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is evil, learning the strength of its aura as if 
having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, you do not detect evil in any 
other object or individual within range. 
Divine Grace (Su) You gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on all saving throws (included above). 
Dragon Bite (Ex) Whenever you use your bloodline to grow claws, you also gain a bite attack. This natural 
attack is made at your full base attack bonus. You add 1½ times your Strength modifier on damage rolls 
made with your bite. 
Dragon Resistances (Ex) You gain resist 5 against your energy type (fire) and a +1 natural armor bonus 
(included above). 
Lay On Hands (Su) You can heal wounds (your own or those of others) by touch. Each day you can use this 
ability a number of times equal to ½ your paladin level plus your Charisma modifier. With one use of 
this ability, you can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels you possess. Using this 
ability is a standard action, unless you target yourself, in which case it is a swift action. Despite the 
name of this ability, you only need one free hand to use this ability. Alternatively, you can use this 
healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels 
you possess. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't 
provoke an attack of opportunity. Undead do not receive a saving throw against this damage. 
Smite Evil (Su) Once per day, as a swift action, you can choose one target within sight to smite. If this target is 
evil, you add your Charisma bonus to your attack rolls and add your paladin level to all damage rolls 
made against the target of your smite. If the target of smite evil is an outsider with the evil subtype, an 
evil-aligned dragon, or an undead creature, the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases 
to 2 points of damage per paladin level you possess. Regardless of the target, smite evil attacks 
automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess. In addition, while smite evil is in effect, you 
gain a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to your AC against attacks made by the target 
of the smite. If you target a creature that is not evil, your smite is wasted with no effect. The smite evil 
effect remains until the target of the smite is dead or the next time the paladin rests and regains her uses 
of this ability.
