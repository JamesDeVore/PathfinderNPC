SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Abundant Step (Su) You can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door. Using this 
ability is a move action that consumes 2 points from your ki pool. Your caster level for this effect is 
equal to your monk level. You cannot take other creatures with you when you use this ability. 
AC Bonus (Ex) When unarmored and unencumbered, you add your Wisdom bonus +3 to your AC and your 
CMD (included above). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when you are 
flat-footed. You lose these bonuses when you are immobilized or helpless, when you wear any armor, or 
when you carry a shield or medium or greater load. 
Improved Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals 
half damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. If you fail a save against such an attack, 
you take only half damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. If you 
are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 

Fast Movement (Ex) If wearing no armor and not carrying a medium load, you gain a +40 enhancement bonus 
to your base land speed. 
Flurry of Blows (Ex) You can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When doing so you may make 
two additional attacks using any combination of unarmed strikes or attacks with a special monk as if 
using the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat (even if you do not meet the prerequisites for the feat). 
For the purpose of these attacks, your base attack bonus is equal to your monk level. For all other 
purposes, such as qualifying for a feat or a prestige class, you use your normal base attack bonus. You 
apply your full Strength bonus to your damage rolls for all successful attacks made with flurry of blows, 
whether the attacks are made with an off-hand or with a weapon wielded in both hands. You may 
substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of a flurry of blows. 
You cannot use any weapon other than an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of 
blows. You cannot use natural weapons as part of a flurry of blows, nor can you make natural attacks in 
addition to your flurry of blows attacks. 
High Jump (Ex) You add your monk level to all Acrobatics checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and 
horizontal jumps (included above). In addition, you always count as having a running start when making 
jump checks using Acrobatics. By spending 1 point from your ki pool as a swift action, you gain a +20 
bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for 1 round. 
Ki Mystic (Su) You gain a pool of ki points equal to ½ your monk level + your Wisdom modifier + 2. If you 
have at least 1 point of ki in your ki pool, you gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge skill checks (included 
above). As a swift action, you can spend 1 ki point immediately before making an ability, or skill check 
to gain a +4 insight bonus on the check. As long as you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, you can 
make a ki strike. Your ki strike allows your unarmed attacks to be treated as magic and lawful weapons 
for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. By spending 1 point from your ki pool, you can make 
one additional attack at your highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. In addition, you 
can spend 1 point to increase your speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, you can spend 1 point from 
your ki pool to give yourself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a 
swift action. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do 
not need to be consecutive. 
Maneuver Training (Ex) You use your monk level in place of your base attack bonus when calculating your 
Combat Maneuver Bonus (included above). Base attack bonuses granted from other classes are 
unaffected and are added normally. 
Mystic Insight (Su) As an immediate action, you can spend 2 ki points to grant an ally within 30 feet the ability 
to reroll a single attack roll or saving throw. The ally must be able to hear you to gain the reroll benefit. 
Mystic Visions (Su) You may receive mystic visions when you rest. These visions can come as a dream, an 
epiphany, or even as the voice of an old friend whispering in your mind. The effect is similar to a 
divination spell with a caster level equal to your monk level. The divination has no casting time; it is just 
part of the normal dreams or visions that occur every night. Using this ability costs 2 ki points that are 
removed from the next day’s total. 
Slow Fall (Ex) When within arm’s reach of a wall you can use it to slow your descent. You take damage as if 
the fall were 60 feet shorter than it actually is. 
Stunning Fist (Ex) You gain Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites. You may 
apply a new condition to the target of your Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 
1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. You can choose to make the target 
fatigued, make the target sickened for 1 minute, or make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. You 
must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with 
themselves (a creature sickened by Stunning Fist cannot become nauseated if hit by Stunning Fist 
again), but additional hits do increase the duration. 
Unarmed Strike You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. Your attacks may be with fist, elbows, 
knees, and feet. This means that you may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such 
thing as an off-hand attack for you. You may apply your full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all of 
your unarmed strikes. Usually your unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but you can choose to deal 
nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on your attack roll. You have the same choice to deal lethal or 

nonlethal damage while grappling. Your unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a 
natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured 
weapons or natural weapons. You deal more damage with your unarmed strikes than a normal person 
would, as shown above. 
Wholeness of Body (Su) You can heal your own wounds as a standard action. You can heal a number of hit 
points of damage equal to your monk level by using 2 points from your ki pool.
