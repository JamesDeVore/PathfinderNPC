SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Armor Training (Ex) When wearing armor, you reduce your armor check penalty by 3 (to a minimum of 0) 
and increase your armor’s maximum Dexterity modifier limit by 3. In addition, your speed is not 
reduced for wearing medium or heavy armor. 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +3 bonus on Will saves against fear effects. 
Breath Weapon (Su) You gain a breath weapon useable once per day. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of 
fire damage per character level –2 in a 30-foot cone. Those caught in the area of the breath receive a 
Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + ½ your character level + your 
Charisma modifier – 2. 
Claws (Su) You can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to 
make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. Each of these attacks 
deals 1d6 points of damage plus your Strength modifier plus 1d6 fire damage. These claws are 
considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming DR. You can use your claws for a number of 
rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. 

Dragon Resistances (Ex) You gain resist fire 10 and a +2 natural armor bonus (included above). 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +5 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using heavy blades, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with heavy blades, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when 
defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against heavy blades. You receive a similar bonus 
with natural attacks and bows, but only at a +4 and +3 bonus, respectively.
