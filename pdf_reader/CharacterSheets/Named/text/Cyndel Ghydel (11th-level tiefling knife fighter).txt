SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Armor Training (Ex) When wearing armor, you reduce your armor check penalty by 2 (to a minimum of 0) 
and increase your armor’s maximum Dexterity modifier limit by 2. In addition, your speed is not 
reduced for wearing medium or heavy armor. 
Blade Sense (Ex) You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made against you with light blades. 
Bravery (Ex) You gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against fear effects. 
Evasion (Ex) If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage 
on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light 
armor or no armor. If helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion. 
Hidden Blade You add ½ your rogue level on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a light blade (included 
above). 

Offensive Defense (Ex) When you hit a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, you gain a 
+1 dodge bonus to AC for each sneak attack die rolled for 1 round. 
Prehensile Tail You possess a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry items. While you cannot wield 
weapons with your tail, you can use it to retrieve small, stowed objects carried on your person as a swift 
action. 
Sneak Attack Your attack deals 2d4 extra damage anytime your target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to 
AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when you flank your target. This bonus 
damage is considered precision damage. Should you score a critical hit with precision damage is not 
multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a weapon 
that deals nonlethal damage (like a sap, whip, or an unarmed strike), you can make a sneak attack that 
deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. You cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to 
deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty. You must be able to see the 
target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. You cannot sneak 
attack while striking a creature with concealment. 
Sneak Stab (Ex) When you make a sneak attack with a dagger, kerambit, kukri, punching daggers, starknife, or 
swordbreaker dagger you use d8s to roll sneak attack damage instead of d6s. For sneak attacks with all 
other weapons, you use d4s instead of d6s. This ability is identical in all other ways to sneak attack, and 
supplements that ability. 
Weapon Training (Ex) You receive a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls when using light blades, to any 
combat maneuver checks made with light blades, and to your Combat Maneuver Defense when 
defending against disarm and sunder attempts made against light blades.
