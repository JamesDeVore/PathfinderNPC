SPECIAL ABILITIES 
AC Bonus (Ex) When unarmored and unencumbered, you add your Wisdom bonus +0 to your AC and your 
CMD (included above). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when you are flat-
footed. You lose these bonuses when you are immobilized or helpless, when you wear any armor, or 
when you carry a shield or medium or greater load. 
Besmara’s Blessing You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception and Profession (sailor) checks. In addition, once 
per week you can reroll a Profession (sailor) check and take the higher result (you must announce that 
you are using this ability before the results of the check are known). 
Bullied You gain a +1 trait bonus on attacks of opportunity attack rolls made with unarmed strikes. 
Elusive (Ex) At 3rd level, a free hand fighter gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC. 
Evasion (Ex) You can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If you make a successful Reflex saving 
throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, you instead take no 
damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. You do not gain the 
benefit of evasion while helpless. 
Fuse Style (Ex) You can fuse two of the styles you know into a more perfect style. You can have two style feat 
stances active at once. Starting a stance provided by a style feat is still a swift action, but when you 
switch to another style feat, you can choose one style whose stance is already active to persist. You may 
only have two style feat stances active at a time. 
Ki Pool (Su) You gain ki points equal to half your monk level + your Wis modifier. As long as you have at 
least 1 point in your ki pool, you can make a ki strike. Your ki strike allows your unarmed attacks to be 
treated as magic and lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. By spending 1 
point from your ki pool, you can make one additional attack at your highest attack bonus when making a 
flurry of blows attack. In addition, you can spend 1 point to increase your speed by 20 feet for 1 round. 
Finally, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to give yourself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. 
Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. The ki pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours 
of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. 
Slow Fall (Ex) When within arm’s reach of a wall you can use it to slow your descent. You take damage as if 
the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. 
Stunning Fist (Ex) You gain Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites. 
Unarmed Strike You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. Your attacks may be with fist, elbows, 
knees, and feet. This means that you may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such 
thing as an off-hand attack for you. You may apply your full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all of 
your unarmed strikes. Usually your unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but you can choose to deal 
nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on your attack roll. You have the same choice to deal lethal or 
nonlethal damage while grappling. Your unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a 
natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured 
weapons or natural weapons. You deal more damage with your unarmed strikes than a normal person 
would, as shown above. 
Whitecap You gain a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip.
