SPECIAL ABILITIES 
Arcane Training You can use spell trigger and spell completion items for your favored class as if one level 
higher. 
Aspect (Su) You can divert up to 2 points from your eidolon’s evolution pool to add evolutions to yourself. 
You cannot select any evolution that your eidolon could not possess, and you must be able to meet the 
requirements as well (except for subtype requirements, so long as your eidolon meets the subtype 
requirement). You cannot select the ability increase evolution through this ability. Any points spent in 
this way are taken from the eidolon’s evolution pool (reducing the total number available to the 

eidolon). You can change the evolutions granted by these points anytime you can change your eidolon’s 
evolutions. 
Bond Senses (Su) You can, as a standard action, share the senses of your eidolon, hearing, seeing, smelling, 
tasting, and touching everything your eidolon does. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day 
equal to your summoner level. There is no maximum range to this effect, but you and your eidolon must 
be on the same plane. You can end this effect as a free action. 
Greater Shield Ally (Su) Whenever an ally is within reach of your eidolon, the ally gains a +2 shield bonus to 
its Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on its saving throws. If this ally you, these bonuses 
increase to +4. This bonus does not apply if your eidolon is grappled, helpless, paralyzed, stunned, or 
unconscious. 
Life Bond (Su) As long as your eidolon has 1 or more hit points, you are protected from harm. Damage in 
excess of that which would reduce you to 0 hit points is instead transferred to your eidolon. This damage 
is transferred 1 point at a time, meaning that as soon as your eidolon is reduced to a number of negative 
hit points equal to its Constitution score, all excess damage remains with you. Effects that cause death 
but don’t deal damage are unaffected by this ability. This ability does not affect spells such as baleful 
polymorph, flesh to stone, imprisonment, or other spells that don’t deal damage. 
Life Link (Su) Whenever your eidolon takes enough damage to send it back to its home plane, as a reaction to 
the damage, you can sacrifice any number of hit points you have without using an action. Each hit point 
sacrificed in this way prevents 1 point of damage dealt to your eidolon. This can prevent your eidolon 
from being sent back to its home plane. In addition, you and your eidolon must remain within 100 feet 
of one another for your eidolon to remain at full strength. If your eidolon is beyond 100 feet but closer 
than 1,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 50%. If your eidolon is more 
than 1,000 feet away but closer than 10,000 feet, its current and maximum hit point totals are reduced by 
75%. If your eidolon is more than 10,000 feet away, it is immediately returned to its home plane. 
Current hit points lost in this way are not restored when your eidolon gets closer to you, but its 
maximum hit point total does climb to the levels indicated and eventually returns to normal. 
Maker’s Call (Su) Three times per day, as a standard action, you can call your eidolon to your side. This 
functions as dimension door, using your summoner caster level. When this ability is used, your eidolon 
appears adjacent to you (or as close as possible if all adjacent spaces are occupied). If your eidolon is out 
of range, the ability is wasted. 
Ongoing Spells The following spells are regularly active upon you and your eidolon: barkskin, heroism, mage 
armor, overland flight (self only), and protection from arrows. Your eidolon also frequently benefits 
from evolution surge (breath weapon) and shield prior to entering dangerous areas or situations. All 
ongoing spell effects function at 15
th-caster level (and thus require a DC 26 caster level check to dispel) 
and their effects are included in the stats where appropriate. Depending on the situation these spells may 
or may not benefit from the Extend Spell metamagic feat, or be cast via the Improved Share Spells feat. 
Transposition (Su) You can use your maker’s call ability to swap locations with your eidolon. If the eidolon 
occupies more squares than you, you can appear in any square occupied by your eidolon. Your eidolon 
must occupy the square that was occupied by you if able, or as close as possible if it is not able.

Improved Evasion (Ex) When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, your 
eidolon takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw and only half damage if it fails. 
Link You and your eidolon share a mental link that allows for communication across any distance (as long as 
you are on the same plane). This communication is a free action, allowing you to give orders to your 
eidolon at any time. In addition, magic items interfere with your connection to your eidolon. As a result, 
you and your eidolon share magic item slots. For example, if you are wearing a ring, your eidolon can 
wear no more than one ring. In case of a conflict, the items worn by you remain active, and those used 
by your eidolon become dormant. Your eidolon must possess the appropriate appendages to use a magic 
item. 
Share Spells (Ex) You can cast a spell with a target of “you” on your eidolon (as a spell with a range of touch) 
instead of on yourself. You can cast spells on your eidolon even if the spells normally do not affect 
creatures of the eidolon’s type (outsider). Spells cast in this way must come from the summoner spell 
list. This ability does not allow your eidolon to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function 
like spells.
